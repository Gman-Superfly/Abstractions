# Critical Issue: Events Not Being Emitted At All

## 🚨 The Real Problem

**You're absolutely correct!** The issue is much worse than just RuntimeWarnings - **the events are not being emitted at all**. Your `@on` handlers are not reacting because the events are being **completely lost**.

## 🔍 Why Events Are Lost

Looking at your debug script:

```python
@on(EntityRegistrationEvent)
async def handle_entity_registration(event: EntityRegistrationEvent):
    """Handle entity registration events."""
    print(f"Entity registered: {event.subject_id}")  # ← This NEVER prints!

# Your code:
for customer in customers:
    customer.promote_to_root()  # ← Should emit EntityPromotionEvent
```

**Expected:** You should see print statements like "Entity promoted: [uuid] to root"
**Actual:** Complete silence - no print statements at all

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Events Completely Skipped

**In sync wrapper (events.py ~line 1132):**
```python
try:
    asyncio.create_task(bus.emit(start_event))
except RuntimeError:
    # No event loop running, skip event
    pass  # ← EVENTS ARE COMPLETELY LOST HERE!
```

**What happens:**
1. Your script runs synchronously (no async context)
2. `asyncio.create_task()` tries to find a running event loop
3. **No loop exists** → `RuntimeError` is raised
4. The `except` block catches it and does **`pass`** (nothing!)
5. **Event is completely discarded** - never emitted!

### Problem 2: Fire-and-Forget Tasks (When Loop Exists)

Even when an event loop exists:
```python
asyncio.create_task(bus.emit(start_event))  # Creates task but never waits for it
```

**Issues:**
- Task starts running but may not complete before script ends
- No guarantee the event reaches handlers
- Script exits before event processing finishes

### Problem 3: Event Bus Not Started

**In get_event_bus() (events.py ~line 57):**
```python
try:
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    if not _event_bus._processor_task:
        loop.create_task(_event_bus.start())  # ← Another unawaited task!
except RuntimeError:
    # No event loop running - will be started when called from async context
    pass  # ← Event bus never starts in sync context!
```

**The Bus Startup Problem:**
- Event bus needs to be started to process events
- In sync contexts, `get_running_loop()` fails
- Bus startup is skipped entirely
- Even if events were emitted, there's no processor to handle them

## 🔄 The Complete Failure Chain

**Your Script Execution:**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 1. No event loop running
    customers, products, orders = create_test_data()
    
    for customer in customers:
        # 2. promote_to_root() decorated with @emit_events
        customer.promote_to_root()
        # ↓
        # 3. Sync wrapper tries to emit events
        # ↓  
        # 4. asyncio.create_task() fails (no loop)
        # ↓
        # 5. RuntimeError caught, event discarded
        # ↓
        # 6. @on handlers never called
```

## 🧪 How to Verify This

**Add debug prints to your handlers:**
```python
@on(EntityRegistrationEvent)
async def handle_entity_registration(event: EntityRegistrationEvent):
    print(f"🎉 HANDLER CALLED: Entity registered: {event.subject_id}")
    # If you don't see this print, events are not being emitted

@on(EntityPromotionEvent)
async def handle_entity_promotion(event: EntityPromotionEvent):
    print(f"🎉 HANDLER CALLED: Entity promoted: {event.subject_id} to root")
    # If you don't see this print, events are not being emitted
```

**Expected output:** Nothing (because events are lost)
**After fix:** You should see the handler print statements

## 🔧 The Fix Requirements

The fix needs to address **all three problems**:

1. **Ensure events are actually emitted** (not skipped)
2. **Ensure event bus is started** in sync contexts  
3. **Ensure events are processed** before script exits

**Solution approach:**
- Use background threading to run async event emission
- Ensure event bus starts even in sync contexts
- Add proper cleanup/waiting mechanisms

## 💡 Summary

**Current State:**
- ❌ Events completely lost in sync contexts
- ❌ Event bus never starts in sync contexts  
- ❌ @on handlers never called
- ❌ RuntimeWarnings indicate failed attempts

**What You Experience:**
- Complete silence from event handlers
- No indication entities are being processed
- Only RuntimeWarnings as evidence something is wrong

**This is a complete event system failure in synchronous contexts, not just a warning issue.**
