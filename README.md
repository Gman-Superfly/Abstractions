# Abstractions: Entity-Native Functional Data Processing Framework

A distributed, data-centric system that brings functional programming principles to entity management, enabling traceable data transformations across distributed systems.

## Setup

```bash
git clone -b maybe_cursed_who_knows https://github.com/furlat/Abstractions.git
cd Abstractions
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

## First steps

This framework treats data as first-class entities that flow through pure functional transformations. Every piece of data has identity, versioning, and provenance. Every transformation is a registered function with automatic tracking. Here's the minimal pattern:

```python
from abstractions.ecs.entity import Entity
from abstractions.ecs.callable_registry import CallableRegistry

# 1. Define your data as entities - the native unit of computation
class Student(Entity):
    name: str = ""
    gpa: float = 0.0

# 2. Register pure functions that transform entities  
@CallableRegistry.register("update_gpa")
def update_gpa(student: Student, new_gpa: float) -> Student:
    student.gpa = new_gpa
    return student

# 3. Execute functional transformations
student = Student(name="Alice", gpa=3.5)
student.promote_to_root()  # Enter the distributed entity space

updated = CallableRegistry.execute("update_gpa", student=student, new_gpa=3.8)
print(f"{updated.name} now has GPA {updated.gpa}")
```

Behind this simple API, the framework automatically:
- Created an immutable version when GPA changed
- Tracked data lineage through the transformation
- Established provenance (which function created which data)
- Enabled distributed access via string addressing
- Emitted events that track the transformation (you can observe these if needed)

You can now reference this data from anywhere using its address:

```python
from abstractions.ecs.functional_api import get

# Access entity data using distributed addressing
student_name = get(f"@{updated.ecs_id}.name")
student_gpa = get(f"@{updated.ecs_id}.gpa")

# Data is addressable across process boundaries
print(f"Retrieved: {student_name} with GPA {student_gpa}")
```

## What this solves

Traditional data processing systems force you to choose between functional purity and practical data management. Pure functional languages give you immutability and composability but struggle with identity and state. Object-oriented systems give you identity and encapsulation but make functional composition difficult. Distributed systems add another layer where you must manually serialize, address, and track data across boundaries.

Another challenge is observability - when transformations happen, you often can't see what triggered what or how changes flow through your system.

This framework unifies these paradigms: your data lives as **entities** with persistent identity, your logic lives as **pure functions** that transform entities, and the system automatically handles **distributed addressing**, **versioning**, and **provenance tracking**. 

Data transformations in distributed systems often follow predictable patterns: data flows through pipelines of transformations, each transformation needs to be traceable, and the results need to be addressable from anywhere. The framework handles these patterns automatically, reducing boilerplate code.

## Theoretical foundation

### Entity-native computation model

In this framework, entities are the fundamental unit of computation. Entities are pure data structures that flow through functional transformations. This separation allows for several useful patterns:

```python
# Entities are immutable snapshots in time
original = Student(name="Bob", gpa=3.0)
original.promote_to_root()

# Transformations create new versions, preserving history
@CallableRegistry.register("apply_bonus")
def apply_bonus(student: Student, bonus: float) -> Student:
    student.gpa = min(4.0, student.gpa + bonus)
    return student

# Execute the transformation
bonus_result = CallableRegistry.execute("apply_bonus", student=original, bonus=0.2)
updated = bonus_result if not isinstance(bonus_result, list) else bonus_result[0]

# Both versions coexist - complete history preserved
assert original.gpa == 3.0  # Original unchanged
assert updated.gpa == 3.2   # New version created
assert original.lineage_id == updated.lineage_id  # Same lineage
```

This model supports distributed processing because entities are self-contained data packets that can be serialized, transmitted, and reconstructed anywhere while maintaining their identity and relationships.

### Functional transformation registry

Functions become the unit of logic in the system. Functions are registered and managed by the framework. This registration provides metadata extraction and automatic integration with the entity lifecycle:

```python
class DeanListResult(Entity):
    student_id: str = ""
    qualified: bool = False
    margin: float = 0.0

# Functions declare their data dependencies via type hints
@CallableRegistry.register("calculate_dean_list")
def calculate_dean_list(student: Student, threshold: float = 3.7) -> DeanListResult:
    return DeanListResult(
        student_id=str(student.ecs_id),
        qualified=student.gpa >= threshold,
        margin=student.gpa - threshold
    )

# Execute the dean list calculation
student = Student(name="Alice", gpa=3.8)
student.promote_to_root()
dean_result = CallableRegistry.execute("calculate_dean_list", student=student, threshold=3.7)
dean_list_result = dean_result if not isinstance(dean_result, list) else dean_result[0]

print(f"Qualified: {dean_list_result.qualified}, Margin: {dean_list_result.margin}")

# The framework automatically:
# 1. Creates input/output entity models from signatures
# 2. Validates types at execution time
# 3. Tracks data flow through the function
# 4. Records provenance in output entities
```

This approach creates a **distributed function registry** where any function can be invoked with any data from anywhere, with complete type safety and tracking.

### String-based distributed addressing

The framework implements a unified addressing scheme that makes all entity data accessible via string addresses. String addresses serve as the foundation for distributed data processing:

```python
from abstractions.ecs.functional_api import get

# Local entity access
student = Student(name="Carol", gpa=3.9)
student.promote_to_root()

# Same data accessible via string address
student_name = get(f"@{student.ecs_id}.name")
student_gpa = get(f"@{student.ecs_id}.gpa")

print(f"Retrieved: {student_name} with GPA {student_gpa}")

class Course(Entity):
    name: str = ""
    credits: int = 0
    grade: str = ""

# Compose new entities from distributed data sources
@CallableRegistry.register("create_transcript")
def create_transcript(name: str, gpa: float, courses: List[str]) -> Course:
    return Course(name=f"Transcript for {name}", credits=len(courses), grade=f"GPA: {gpa}")

# Execute with mixed local and remote data
transcript = CallableRegistry.execute("create_transcript",
    name=f"@{student.ecs_id}.name",      # From entity
    gpa=f"@{student.ecs_id}.gpa",        # From entity  
    courses=["Math", "Physics", "CS"]     # Direct data
)
transcript_result = transcript if not isinstance(transcript, list) else transcript[0]
print(f"Created: {transcript_result.name}")
```

This addressing provides **location transparency** - your functions don't need to know where data lives, just how to address it. The framework handles resolution, whether the entity is in local memory, a remote cache, or a distributed store.

### Automatic provenance and lineage tracking

Every transformation is recorded in the entity graph, creating a complete audit trail of how data was derived. Provenance tracking is built into the computation model:

```python
# Create a complex transformation pipeline
@CallableRegistry.register("normalize_grades")
def normalize_grades(cohort: List[Student]) -> List[Student]:
    avg_gpa = sum(s.gpa for s in cohort) / len(cohort)
    return [
        Student(name=s.name, gpa=s.gpa / avg_gpa * 3.0)
        for s in cohort
    ]

students = [Student(name=f"S{i}", gpa=3.0+i*0.2) for i in range(5)]
for s in students:
    s.promote_to_root()

# Execute the normalization
normalized_result = CallableRegistry.execute("normalize_grades", cohort=students)
normalized = normalized_result if isinstance(normalized_result, list) else [normalized_result]

print(f"Normalized {len(normalized)} students")

# Each output entity tracks its lineage and versioning
for i, norm in enumerate(normalized[:3]):  # Show first 3
    print(f"{norm.name} was created with lineage {norm.lineage_id}")
    print(f"Entity ID: {norm.ecs_id}, derived from original student data")
```

This provenance tracking supports **data lineage queries**, **reproducible computations**, and **debugging of data flows** across distributed systems.

### Event-driven observation

The framework emits events when entities change or functions execute. These events contain only UUID references and basic metadata - they don't duplicate your data. You can use them to observe what's happening in your system:

```python
from abstractions.events.events import Event, CreatedEvent, on, emit

# Define custom event types
class StudentCreatedEvent(CreatedEvent[Student]):
    type: str = "student.created"

# Event handlers using the correct patterns
@on(StudentCreatedEvent)
async def log_student_creation(event: StudentCreatedEvent):
    print(f"Student created: {event.subject_id}")

# Pattern-based event handler
@on(pattern="student.*")
def handle_all_student_events(event: Event):
    print(f"Student event: {event.type}")

# Predicate-based event handler
@on(predicate=lambda e: hasattr(e, 'subject_id') and e.subject_id is not None)
async def track_all_entities(event: Event):
    print(f"Entity event: {event.type} for {event.subject_id}")

# The events contain references, not data
# This lets you track what's happening without affecting performance
```

Events work well for debugging, monitoring, and building reactive systems. They're designed to be lightweight - you can ignore them entirely if you don't need them.

### Multi-entity transformations and unpacking

The framework natively handles functions that produce multiple entities, automatically managing their relationships and distribution:

```python
from typing import Tuple
from pydantic import Field

class Assessment(Entity):
    student_id: str = Field(default="")
    performance_level: str = Field(default="")
    gpa_score: float = Field(default=0.0)

class Recommendation(Entity):
    student_id: str = Field(default="")
    action: str = Field(default="")
    reasoning: str = Field(default="")

@CallableRegistry.register("analyze_performance")
def analyze_performance(student: Student) -> Tuple[Assessment, Recommendation]:
    assessment = Assessment(
        student_id=str(student.ecs_id),
        performance_level="high" if student.gpa > 3.5 else "standard",
        gpa_score=student.gpa
    )
    recommendation = Recommendation(
        student_id=str(student.ecs_id),
        action="advanced_placement" if student.gpa > 3.5 else "standard_track",
        reasoning=f"Based on GPA of {student.gpa}"
    )
    return assessment, recommendation

# Automatic unpacking and relationship tracking
student = Student(name="Alice", gpa=3.8)
student.promote_to_root()

result = CallableRegistry.execute("analyze_performance", student=student)

# Handle Union[Entity, List[Entity]] return type
if isinstance(result, list):
    assessment, recommendation = result[0], result[1]
else:
    assessment, recommendation = result

print(f"Assessment: {assessment.performance_level}")
print(f"Recommendation: {recommendation.action}")

# Entities know they're siblings from the same computation
if hasattr(assessment, 'sibling_output_entities'):
    print(f"Assessment siblings: {assessment.sibling_output_entities}")
if hasattr(recommendation, 'sibling_output_entities'):
    print(f"Recommendation siblings: {recommendation.sibling_output_entities}")
```

This enables **complex data flows** where single computations produce multiple related outputs that may be consumed by different downstream systems.

### Distributed execution patterns

The framework supports multiple execution patterns optimized for different distributed scenarios:

```python
# Pattern 1: Direct entity transformation (local computation)
result = CallableRegistry.execute("update_gpa", student=student, new_gpa=3.9)

# Pattern 2: Address-based transformation (remote data)
result = CallableRegistry.execute("update_gpa", 
    student=f"@{remote_student_id}",  # Fetched from distributed store
    new_gpa=3.9
)

# Pattern 3: Async transformation (concurrent processing)
results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    CallableRegistry.aexecute("update_gpa", student=s, new_gpa=s.gpa + 0.1)
    for s in students
])

# Pattern 4: Composite transformation (data from multiple sources)
analysis = await CallableRegistry.aexecute("cross_reference_analysis",
    student=f"@{student_id}",          # From service A
    transcript=f"@{transcript_id}",     # From service B  
    recommendations=f"@{recs_id}"       # From service C
)
```

Each pattern maintains the same guarantees of immutability, versioning, and provenance while optimizing for different distribution scenarios.

### Async and concurrent execution without interference

The framework's immutable entity model and automatic versioning enable safe concurrent and async execution without locks or synchronization. Multiple functions can process the same entities simultaneously without interference:

```python
class AnalysisResult(Entity):
    student_id: str = ""
    avg: float = 0.0
    analysis_type: str = ""

# Register both sync and async functions
@CallableRegistry.register("analyze_grades")
def analyze_grades(student: Student, grades: List[float]) -> AnalysisResult:
    """Synchronous grade analysis"""
    return AnalysisResult(
        student_id=str(student.ecs_id),
        avg=sum(grades)/len(grades),
        analysis_type="sync"
    )

@CallableRegistry.register("analyze_grades_async")
async def analyze_grades_async(student: Student, grades: List[float]) -> AnalysisResult:
    """Async grade analysis with external API calls"""
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate API call
    return AnalysisResult(
        student_id=str(student.ecs_id),
        avg=sum(grades)/len(grades),
        analysis_type="async"
    )

# Execute concurrently without interference
student = Student(name="TestStudent", gpa=3.5)
student.promote_to_root()

batch_results = await asyncio.gather(
    CallableRegistry.aexecute("analyze_grades",
        student=f"@{student.ecs_id}",
        grades=[3.8, 3.9, 3.7]
    ),
    CallableRegistry.aexecute("analyze_grades_async", 
        student=f"@{student.ecs_id}",  # Same student, no problem!
        grades=[3.8, 3.9, 3.7, 4.0]
    )
)

# Results processed concurrently without interference
for i, result in enumerate(batch_results):
    if isinstance(result, list):
        result = result[0] if result else None
    if result and isinstance(result, AnalysisResult):
        print(f"Result {i+1}: avg={result.avg:.2f}, type={result.analysis_type}")
    else:
        print(f"Result {i+1}: No valid result")

# Each execution:
# 1. Gets its own immutable copy of input entities
# 2. Creates new output entities with unique IDs
# 3. Records its own provenance chain
# 4. Never interferes with other executions
```

This concurrency model scales naturally to distributed systems where different nodes process the same data. Since entities are immutable and every transformation creates new versions, there's no shared mutable state to coordinate. The framework handles all the complexity of maintaining consistency and tracking lineage across concurrent executions.

### Multi-step reactive cascades

You can combine async execution with event handlers to create cascading computations that work across distributed systems. Here's a simple example that processes student data in multiple steps:

```python
from abstractions.events.events import Event, CreatedEvent, on, emit
from uuid import UUID, uuid4
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ProcessedStudent(BaseModel):
    id: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid4)
    student_id: UUID
    processed_gpa: float = 0.0
    processing_notes: str = ""
    status: str = "processed"

class BatchReport(BaseModel):
    id: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid4)
    batch_id: str
    student_count: int = 0
    average_gpa: float = 0.0
    batch_status: str = "completed"

class StudentProcessedEvent(CreatedEvent[ProcessedStudent]):
    type: str = "student.processed"

class BatchCompletedEvent(CreatedEvent[BatchReport]):
    type: str = "batch.completed"

# Global collections for event-driven batching
processed_students: List[UUID] = []

# Step 1: Process individual students
async def process_student(student: Student) -> ProcessedStudent:
    # Some processing work
    processed = ProcessedStudent(
        student_id=student.id,
        processed_gpa=student.gpa * 1.1,  # 10% boost
        processing_notes=f"Processed {student.name} with GPA boost",
        status="processed"
    )
    
    # Emit event to trigger cascade
    await emit(StudentProcessedEvent(
        subject_type=ProcessedStudent,
        subject_id=processed.id,
        created_id=processed.id
    ))
    
    return processed

# Step 2: Event handler that automatically collects processed students
@on(StudentProcessedEvent)
async def collect_processed_students(event: StudentProcessedEvent):
    if event.subject_id is not None:
        processed_students.append(event.subject_id)
        
        # When we have enough students, trigger batch analysis
        if len(processed_students) >= 3:
            batch = processed_students[:3]
            processed_students.clear()
            await trigger_batch_analysis(batch)

async def trigger_batch_analysis(batch_students):
    """Process a batch of students."""
    print(f"Processing batch of {len(batch_students)} students...")
    
    # Create batch report
    batch_report = BatchReport(
        batch_id=f"BATCH_{len(batch_students)}",
        student_count=len(batch_students),
        average_gpa=3.6,  # Simplified calculation
        batch_status="completed"
    )
    
    # Emit batch completion event
    await emit(BatchCompletedEvent(
        subject_type=BatchReport,
        subject_id=batch_report.id,
        created_id=batch_report.id
    ))

# Usage: Just process students, everything else happens automatically
students = [Student(name=f"Student_{i}", gpa=3.0 + i*0.1) for i in range(7)]
for student in students:
    await process_student(student)

# Step 3: Analyze batches and create reports
@CallableRegistry.register("analyze_batch")
async def analyze_batch(student_ids: List[str]) -> BatchReport:
    # Fetch the processed students
    students = [EntityRegistry.get_stored_entity(id) for id in student_ids]
    
    # Simple map-reduce pattern
    avg_gpa = sum(s.processed_gpa for s in students) / len(students)
    
    return BatchReport(
        batch_size=len(students),
        average_gpa=avg_gpa,
        student_ids=student_ids
    )

# Step 4: When reports are created, trigger final aggregation
reports = []

@on(lambda event: event.type == "created" and event.subject_type == BatchReport)
async def aggregate_reports(event):
    reports.append(event.subject_id)
    
    # Every 3 reports, create a summary
    if len(reports) >= 3:
        batch_reports = reports[:3]
        reports.clear()
        await CallableRegistry.aexecute("create_summary", report_ids=batch_reports)

# Usage: Just process students, everything else happens automatically
for student in students:
    await CallableRegistry.aexecute("process_student", student=student)

# The system automatically:
# 1. Processes each student individually (async)
# 2. Collects processed students into batches of 10
# 3. Analyzes each batch to create reports
# 4. Aggregates reports into summaries
# This creates a simple map-reduce pipeline through events
```

This pattern creates emergent behavior where the system automatically organizes work into batches and aggregates results without central coordination. Each step only knows about its immediate inputs and outputs, but the event system coordinates the overall flow.


### Pydantic-AI Integration: Typed Goal-Driven Function Calling

The framework includes a natural language interface through pydantic-ai agents that act as intelligent coordinators for the entity system. These agents understand registered functions and can execute complex workflows using natural language instructions while maintaining strict type safety.

#### Registry Agent Architecture

The registry agent is a specialized pydantic-ai agent that operates as a **state-space navigator**. It cannot create new data - it can only **forward propagate** through the registered function space to reach a desired goal state from the current state:

```python
from abstractions.registry_agent import TypedAgentFactory

# The agent has access to these tools:
# - execute_function(function_name, **kwargs) - Execute registered functions
# - list_functions() - Discover available functions  
# - get_all_lineages() - Explore entity relationships
# - get_entity() - Inspect specific entities

# Create an agent that produces FunctionExecutionResult entities
class FunctionExecutionResult(Entity):
    function_name: str
    success: bool
    result_data: Dict[str, Any]

agent = TypedAgentFactory.create_agent(FunctionExecutionResult)
```

The agent operates within strict constraints:
- **Cannot create entities directly** - must use registered functions
- **Cannot modify entities in place** - follows immutability rules
- **Can only reference existing entities** via string addressing (`@uuid.field`)
- **Must produce typed results** that match the specified goal type

#### Goal Objects and State Navigation

Goal objects define both the **target state** and **validation rules** for agent execution. They encapsulate:

```python
class BaseGoal(BaseModel):
    goal_type: str                    # Type of goal being pursued
    goal_completed: bool = False      # Whether target state reached
    summary: str                      # Natural language summary
    
    # The agent sets this to reference the result entity
    typed_result_ecs_address: Optional[str] = None
    
    # Automatically loaded from the address
    typed_result: Optional[Entity] = None
    
    # Or populated if goal fails
    error: Optional[GoalError] = None
```

The agent must reach one of three terminal states:
1. **Success with ECS address** - Point to result entity via `typed_result_ecs_address`
2. **Success with direct entity** - Set `typed_result` directly
3. **Failure** - Populate `error` with structured failure information

#### Single Function Execution

Simple function execution with entity addressing:

```python
class DateRangeConfig(ConfigEntity):
    start_date: str
    end_date: str

@CallableRegistry.register("calculate_revenue_metrics")
async def calculate_revenue_metrics(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> FunctionExecutionResult:
    return FunctionExecutionResult(
        function_name="calculate_revenue_metrics",
        success=True,
        result_data={"total_revenue": 15750.50, "orders": 123}
    )

# Usage
date_config = DateRangeConfig(start_date="2024-10-01", end_date="2024-12-31")
date_config.promote_to_root()

agent = TypedAgentFactory.create_agent(FunctionExecutionResult)
result = await agent.run(f"""
Calculate Q4 2024 revenue metrics using:
start_date=@{date_config.ecs_id}.start_date
end_date=@{date_config.ecs_id}.end_date
""")

# Agent navigates: current state → execute function → goal state
print(f"Revenue: ${result.output.typed_result.result_data['total_revenue']}")
```

The agent automatically:
- Parses string addresses to extract entity field values
- Validates parameter types before function execution  
- Creates properly typed goal objects with results

#### Multi-Step Workflow Coordination

Complex workflows with interdependent function calls:

```python
class UserCredentials(Entity):
    user_id: str
    role: str
    session_token: str

class DataTransformConfig(Entity):
    source_format: str
    target_format: str
    batch_size: int

@CallableRegistry.register("validate_user_credentials")
async def validate_user_credentials(credentials: UserCredentials) -> AuthValidationResult:
    return AuthValidationResult(
        user_id=credentials.user_id,
        is_authenticated=len(credentials.session_token) > 10,
        is_authorized=credentials.role in ["admin", "manager"]
    )

@CallableRegistry.register("transform_data_batch")
async def transform_data_batch(config: DataTransformConfig) -> DataProcessingResult:
    return DataProcessingResult(
        process_id=f"BATCH_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}",
        records_processed=config.batch_size,
        transformation_applied=f"{config.source_format}_to_{config.target_format}"
    )

# Multi-step execution
user_creds = UserCredentials(user_id="USR_12345", role="manager", session_token="VALID_SESSION")
data_config = DataTransformConfig(source_format="csv", target_format="json", batch_size=500)

workflow_agent = TypedAgentFactory.create_agent(FunctionExecutionResult)
result = await workflow_agent.run(f"""
Execute data processing workflow:
1. Validate credentials using @{user_creds.ecs_id}
2. Transform data using @{data_config.ecs_id}
3. Pass user_id from step 1 and process_id from step 2 to generate audit
""")
```

The agent maintains execution context across steps, automatically threading results between function calls and managing complex parameter dependencies.

#### Multi-Objective Goals (Union Types)

Agents can be configured with multiple valid goal states, succeeding when any of the specified result types is achieved:

```python
class DataProcessingResult(Entity):
    """Technical processing metrics."""
    process_id: str
    processing_duration_ms: float
    database_queries_executed: int
    performance_metrics: Dict[str, Any]

class WorkflowSummaryResult(Entity):
    """Business workflow summary."""
    workflow_id: str
    order_status: str
    total_order_value: float
    business_impact: str

# Agent can succeed with either result type
multi_objective_agent = TypedAgentFactory.create_agent([DataProcessingResult, WorkflowSummaryResult])

# Agent chooses the most appropriate path given the available functions and context
result = await multi_objective_agent.run("Process the order data")
# May return either DataProcessingResult OR WorkflowSummaryResult depending on execution path
```

This enables **multi-objective optimization** where the agent can reach the goal state through different valid terminal states, choosing the most appropriate based on available functions and execution context.

#### Few-Shot Learning for Path Selection

When the state space is very large, few-shot learning through prompt examples helps guide agent navigation:

```python
# Technical bias examples (debugging technique for large state spaces)
technical_examples = """
Example: execute_function("process_order_inventory", order="@uuid", config="@uuid2")
Example: execute_function("calculate_shipping_details", order="@uuid", config="@uuid3")
"""

# Business bias examples (alternative path selection)
business_examples = """
Example: execute_function("finalize_order_workflow", order="@uuid")
Example: execute_function("send_customer_notification", order="@uuid", status="confirmed")
"""

# Same multi-objective agent, different path selection priors
technical_agent = TypedAgentFactory.create_agent(
    [DataProcessingResult, WorkflowSummaryResult],
    custom_examples=technical_examples  # Guides toward technical functions
)

business_agent = TypedAgentFactory.create_agent(
    [DataProcessingResult, WorkflowSummaryResult],
    custom_examples=business_examples   # Guides toward business functions
)
```

The examples act as **function selection priors** - not features, but prompt engineering techniques to help agents navigate large function registries more effectively.

#### Model Selection and Advanced Features

Agents support different language models and enhanced error handling:

```python
# Model selection for different capabilities
fast_agent = TypedAgentFactory.create_agent(
    FunctionExecutionResult,
    model='anthropic:claude-3-5-haiku-20241022'  # Fast for simple tasks
)

reasoning_agent = TypedAgentFactory.create_agent(
    [DataProcessingResult, WorkflowSummaryResult],
    model='anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514'  # Complex reasoning
)

# Enhanced address validation with debugging context
result = await agent.run("Process @invalid-uuid.bad-field")
# Returns structured error with:
# - Step-by-step validation process  
# - Suggestions for address syntax fixes
# - Available entity fields and similar UUIDs
# - Complete debugging context
```

#### Theoretical Foundation

The registry agent implements a **constrained state-space search** where:

- **Current State**: Set of entities that can be currently referenced by string addresses
- **Goal State**: Typed result entity matching the specified goal type, it can include further "semantic" validation, similar to liquid types using arbitrary fields and model validators.
- **Actions**: Registered functions that transform and create entities
- **Constraints**: Type safety, immutability, address validation

The agent navigates this space using natural language understanding to select appropriate functions and parameter bindings, but cannot violate the fundamental constraints of the entity system. This creates an intelligent interface that maintains all the guarantees of functional purity while enabling complex reasoning about data transformations.

This approach transforms the entity framework into a goal-oriented programming system where natural language descriptions of desired outcomes are automatically translated into sequences of registered function calls with proper entity addressing and type-safe result validation.

## Core concepts for distributed data processing

### Entity as distributed data unit

Entities in this framework are designed for distribution. Each entity is a self-contained data unit with:
- **Globally unique identity** (ecs_id) that works across system boundaries
- **Immutable state** that can be safely cached and replicated
- **Complete metadata** for versioning, lineage, and provenance
- **Efficient serialization** for network transport

### Function as distributed computation unit  

Functions are the unit of computation that can be deployed and executed anywhere:
- **Location independent** - functions can run wherever the data is
- **Self-describing** - type signatures enable automatic validation
- **Composable** - functions can be chained into complex pipelines
- **Traceable** - every execution is recorded in the entity graph

### Address as distributed reference

String addresses provide a universal way to reference data across systems:
- **Human readable** - `@uuid.field.subfield` is self-documenting
- **Network portable** - strings work across any transport
- **Lazy resolution** - addresses are resolved only when needed
- **Access control ready** - addresses can be filtered by permissions

### Event as optional signal

The framework emits events to signal when things happen:
- **UUID-based** - events contain entity IDs, not copies of data
- **Hierarchical** - events can be grouped by operation
- **Optional** - you can ignore events entirely if you don't need them
- **Reactive** - events can trigger other functions automatically

## Implementation architecture for distributed systems

The framework is architected to support distributed deployment patterns:

**Entity Layer**: Provides persistent identity and versioning suitable for distributed stores. Entities can be serialized to any format and reconstructed with full fidelity.

**Function Registry**: Acts as a distributed function catalog where functions can be discovered, invoked remotely, and composed into workflows.

**Address Resolution**: Implements a pluggable resolver architecture that can fetch entities from local memory, remote caches, databases, or microservices.

**Execution Engine**: Supports multiple execution strategies from local in-process to distributed map-reduce patterns while maintaining the same API.

## Validated examples and patterns

The framework includes comprehensive examples demonstrating real-world usage patterns:

Each example includes comprehensive test suites validating the documented behavior and can be run directly to see the framework in action.


## Why this approach scales

This framework scales well with distributed systems:

1. **Data is naturally distributed** - The framework embraces this rather than hiding it
2. **Computation follows data** - Functions can execute wherever data lives
3. **Everything needs tracking** - Built-in provenance eliminates custom audit code
4. **Immutability simplifies distribution** - No distributed state synchronization problems
5. **Addresses enable loose coupling** - Services can share data without tight integration
6. **Observability helps understanding** - Events help you understand what's happening as systems grow

By making these distributed patterns first-class concepts in the framework, you get the benefits of functional programming (immutability, composability, testability) with the pragmatic needs of distributed systems (identity, addressing, versioning) in a single coherent model.

The result is a framework where you can start with a simple single-process application and scale to a distributed system without changing your core logic - just your deployment topology. Your functions remain pure, your data remains traceable, and your system remains comprehensible even as it grows.
