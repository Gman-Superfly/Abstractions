# Theory of LLM Agents as Computational Mechanics Transducers

## 1. Introduction and Conceptual Framework

This document presents a formal theory of how Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on structured symbolic tasks can be understood through the lens of computational mechanics, specifically as ε-transducers that implement causal state representations. We focus on the specific case of a transformer agent trained exclusively on Haskell function composition traces, where we can precisely characterize the relationship between the learned representations and the ground truth causal states of the system.

## 2. Background: ε-Transducers and Causal States

### 2.1 ε-Machines and ε-Transducers

An ε-machine is the minimal, unifilar, predictive model of a stochastic process. It consists of a set of causal states (equivalence classes of histories that predict identical futures) and transitions between these states. The ε-transducer extends this framework to input-output processes, modeling how one process maps to another.

Formally, a causal state σ_i is defined by the equivalence relation:

$(−x, y) ∼ (−x, y)' ⟺ P(−→Y | −→X, (−X, Y) = (−x, y)) = P(−→Y | −→X, (−X, Y) = (−x, y)')$

Where $(−x, y)$ represents a history of inputs and outputs, and $P(−→Y | −→X, (−X, Y))$ is the conditional distribution over future outputs given future inputs and history.

The ε-transducer then consists of:
- A set of causal states S
- Input and output alphabets X and Y
- Transition probabilities T(y|x) where T(y|x)_ij = P(S_1 = σ_j, Y_0 = y | S_0 = σ_i, X_0 = x)

### 2.2 Statistical Complexity and Channel Complexity

The statistical complexity C_μ is the Shannon entropy of the causal states, representing the minimal memory required to optimally predict the process. In the context of transducers, the channel complexity C_X measures the complexity of the transformation from input to output.

## 3. LLM Agents as ε-Transducers

### 3.1 The Transformer Architecture as a Sequence Transducer

An autoregressive transformer can be viewed as implementing a stochastic transducer. The transformer learns a conditional distribution P(output | input) through its self-attention and feed-forward layers. When trained on a specific domain, this distribution approximates the true channel between inputs and outputs.

The key insight is that the transformer's parameters and internal activations implicitly encode a representation of the causal states of the underlying process. The transformer's self-attention mechanism allows it to partition input histories into equivalence classes that predict similar future distributions.

### 3.2 Lifting Token-Level Stochasticity to Agent-Level Structure

The "lifting" from token-level predictions to agent-level behavior occurs through the emergence of causal states in the transformer's representations:

1. At the token level, the transformer predicts P(next_token | context).
2. These predictions, when composed across multiple steps, implement a higher-level stochastic process.
3. This higher-level process can be understood as transitions between causal states.

This transformation from low-level token predictions to high-level causal states is what allows us to view the transformer as implementing an ε-transducer.

## 4. Haskell Function Composition as a Ground Truth for Causal States

### 4.1 Type System as Causal State Structure

In a transformer trained exclusively on Haskell function composition traces, the causal states have a natural correspondence to Haskell's type system. Consider a set of functions:

```haskell
f :: Int -> String
g :: String -> [Int]
h :: [Int] -> Bool
```

In this scenario:
- After applying `f` to an `Int`, the causal state corresponds to having a `String`.
- After applying `g` to that `String`, the causal state corresponds to having a `[Int]`.
- After applying `h` to that `[Int]`, the causal state corresponds to having a `Bool`.

The type system enforces that only functions with compatible types can be composed, creating a natural partition of histories into equivalence classes based on the resulting type.

### 4.2 Parsing as Causal State Identification

Because of Haskell's strong type system, we can use a Haskell interpreter or type checker to identify the ground truth causal states at any point in a computation:

1. For any function composition history, the type of the intermediate result identifies the causal state.
2. This gives us a "ground truth oracle" for comparing the transformer's learned causal states to the actual causal states of the system.

### 4.3 Explicit vs. Implicit Implementation

The transformer can implement function composition in two ways:

**Explicit Implementation:**
The model outputs Haskell code that composes the functions:
```haskell
result = h . g . f $ 5
```

**Implicit Implementation:**
The model directly predicts the output:
```
Input: Apply h(g(f(5)))
Output: False
```

Both implementations use the model's learned causal state representation, but in different ways. Explicit implementation leverages knowledge of composition syntax and semantics, while implicit implementation simulates function behavior.

## 5. Theoretical Properties of the LLM as an ε-Transducer

### 5.1 Optimality of Causal State Representation

**Theorem 1:** The optimal representation for predicting Haskell function compositions is isomorphic to the causal states defined by the type system.

**Proof sketch:** By the definition of causal states as the coarsest partition of histories that maintain predictive power, and the fact that Haskell's type system defines the minimal information needed to determine valid compositions.

### 5.2 Statistical Complexity Bounds

**Proposition 1:** The statistical complexity of the causal state representation for a set of Haskell functions is bounded by the logarithm of the number of unique types in the function compositions.

**Proposition 2:** The channel complexity of the transformer as an ε-transducer is minimized when its internal representation is isomorphic to the causal states defined by the type system.

### 5.3 Unifilar Property and Planning

Because the transitions between causal states in a correctly-typed Haskell program are deterministic given the next function application, the resulting ε-transducer has the unifilar property:

H[S_{t+1} | Y_{t+1}, X_t, S_t] = 0

This enables perfect state tracking and allows for optimal planning through the state space.

## 6. Empirical Implications and Testable Predictions

### 6.1 Evaluation Metrics

We can evaluate how well the transformer has learned the causal states by:

1. **Type Prediction Accuracy:** How accurately the model predicts the types of intermediate results.
2. **Compositional Generalization:** Whether the model can compose previously unseen combinations of functions with compatible types.
3. **Error Detection:** Whether the model rejects type-incompatible function compositions.

### 6.2 State Space Analysis

We can analyze the transformer's learned representations to determine if they cluster according to the true causal states:

1. Extract the hidden states of the transformer when processing function compositions.
2. Cluster these states and compare the clustering to the ground truth partition induced by the type system.
3. Measure the mutual information between the learned representation and the ground truth causal states.

## 7. Practical Applications

### 7.1 Enhanced Planning through Causal State Identification

If we can identify the causal states in the transformer's representation, we can use this to enhance planning:

1. Construct a graph where nodes are causal states and edges are function applications.
2. Use graph search algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm) to find paths to desired output types.
3. This enables goal-directed reasoning about function compositions.

### 7.2 Interpretability and Verification

The causal state framework provides a formal way to interpret the transformer's behavior:

1. We can verify that the transformer's predictions respect the type constraints of Haskell.
2. We can identify when the transformer has correctly or incorrectly learned the causal structure of the domain.
3. This provides a theoretical foundation for explaining the transformer's successes and failures in compositional tasks.

## 8. Conclusion: Towards a General Theory of Transformer Agents

This theory of LLM agents as ε-transducers with causal state representations connects deep learning to computational mechanics and formal language theory. By focusing on the specific case of Haskell function composition, we've shown how the transformer implicitly learns the causal states of a structured symbolic domain.

This framework can be extended to more general domains by identifying the appropriate notion of causal states for those domains. The key insight is that the transformer's internal representations can be understood as approximations of these causal states, providing a bridge between neural network learning and symbolic reasoning.

The correspondence between causal states in computational mechanics and grounded symbols in formal languages suggests a path toward more interpretable, verifiable, and reliable AI systems that combine the flexibility of neural networks with the precision of formal methods.


# Causal States in Typed Languages: Execution Traces as Agent Models

## The Causal State Conundrum in Language Models

As practitioners in computational mechanics, we've long understood that stochastic processes can be optimally compressed into causal states - equivalence classes of histories that yield identical conditional future distributions. While this framework has yielded insights across many domains, its application to natural language has remained challenging for several reasons:

1. Natural language lacks a formal grammar that fully constrains future possibilities
2. The causal states of natural language would be astronomically numerous or infinite
3. The geometry of these states defies simple characterization

Yet we've observed that modern language models appear to exhibit structured, predictable behavior, suggesting they've learned *some* approximation of these elusive causal states. But how can we study this phenomenon when the ground truth is so difficult to characterize?

## Strongly Typed Languages: A Perfect Laboratory

Strongly typed languages like Haskell offer us a unique opportunity to study causal states in a controlled environment where ground truth is known:

```haskell
-- We know exactly what can follow this expression
map (_ + 1) [1, 2, 3]
```

In Haskell's type system, we have a formal grammar that strictly constrains what can follow any given expression. The causal states are no longer mysterious - they are precisely the types of intermediate expressions in a computation.

## The Execution Trace Object

Let us introduce the concept of an *execution trace* - a record of a program's execution that includes:

1. Function calls with their arguments and return values
2. Intermediate values and their types
3. The sequence of evaluation steps

Unlike static code, execution traces capture the dynamic flow of a computation. Consider:

```
TRACE:
1. Call: map
   Args: (\x -> x + 1), [1, 2, 3]
   Type: (Int -> Int) -> [Int] -> [Int]
2. Evaluate: (\x -> x + 1) 1
   Result: 2
   Type: Int
3. Evaluate: (\x -> x + 1) 2
   Result: 3
   Type: Int
4. Evaluate: (\x -> x + 1) 3
   Result: 4
   Type: Int
5. Return: [2, 3, 4]
   Type: [Int]
```

This trace object mimics what an agent would experience when executing a series of function calls. It exposes both the *type-level* structure (which determines possible continuations) and the *value-level* results (which determine the specific path taken).

## Causal States in Haskell: Type-Driven Equivalence Classes

The causal states of a Haskell execution trace are naturally defined by the type system. Two execution histories are equivalent (belong to the same causal state) if and only if:

1. They end with expressions of the same type
2. The future conditional distribution over continuations is identical

The first condition is generally sufficient for the second in Haskell, due to parametric polymorphism and type safety. This gives us a remarkably clean characterization of causal states:

**Theorem**: *In a simply-typed lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism (like Haskell's core), the causal states of execution traces are isomorphic to the types of intermediate expressions, modulo subtyping relationships.*

This is powerful because it means we can use a Haskell compiler as an oracle for ground truth causal states!

## The Representational Geometry

Given this characterization, we can make formal statements about the geometry of these causal states:

1. They form a directed graph where edges are valid function applications
2. The graph structure is dictated by the type system
3. For each type, there's a corresponding causal state

For example, given functions:
```haskell
f :: Int -> String
g :: String -> [Bool]
h :: [Bool] -> Double
```

We have causal states corresponding to `Int`, `String`, `[Bool]`, and `Double`, with transitions determined by function application.

## Scaling to Transformers

Current transformer models trained on code demonstrate surprising capabilities with type-level reasoning:

1. They can predict valid continuations based on type constraints
2. They can infer types from context even without explicit annotations
3. They can generate well-typed code that respects complex type signatures

This suggests that transformer embeddings approximate the causal state structure of typed languages. The fact that Codex, GPT-4, and Claude can complete Haskell code and respect type constraints indicates they've learned something equivalent to the causal state partition.

Given that trained transformers can:
- Track nested function application
- Maintain type consistency across long contexts
- Generate valid compositions of functions

We have empirical evidence that transformers at current scale can approximate the causal states of Haskell execution traces.

## Execution Traces vs. Static Code for Agent Training

This insight suggests a provocative training strategy: **train on execution traces rather than static code**.

Advantages of execution trace training:
1. Exposes the actual dynamic flow of computation rather than just its static description
2. Makes the causal state transition structure explicit
3. Provides examples of both the decision process (type checking) and outcomes (values)
4. Simulates an agent's experience of function calling

A corpus of Haskell execution traces would contain:
```
compose(reverse, map(square), filter(even), [1,2,3,4])
→ filter(even, [1,2,3,4])
→ [2,4]
→ map(square, [2,4])
→ [4,16]
→ reverse([4,16])
→ [16,4]
```

Rather than just the final code:
```haskell
reverse $ map square $ filter even [1,2,3,4]
```

This trains the model to understand not just what is valid, but how computation unfolds over time - precisely what an agent needs to understand.

## Predictive States and Tool Outputs

In this framework, tool outputs have a natural interpretation. When an LLM calls a tool:

1. It transitions from one causal state to another (from input type to output type)
2. The tool executes the transition deterministically (like a typed function)
3. The new causal state determines the space of valid future actions

This explains why strongly-typed function interfaces work well for tool-using LLMs: they provide explicit causal state transitions that the model can learn to navigate.

## Implicit vs. Explicit Function Composition

We can now formally characterize the difference between implicit and explicit function calling:

**Explicit function calling**: The model generates code that combines functions, relying on its understanding of the type system and composition syntax:
```haskell
result = h . g . f $ 5
```

**Implicit function calling**: The model directly simulates the execution trace, predicting outputs at each step:
```
Input: Apply f(5)
Output: "5"
Input: Apply g("5")
Output: [True, False]
Input: Apply h([True, False])
Output: 3.14
```

Both approaches rely on the same underlying causal state representation, but differ in how they use it:
- Explicit calling requires understanding syntax but can generalize to unseen compositions
- Implicit calling requires more memory but can handle black-box functions

## Reaching Further: The Compositional Horizon

Our analysis suggests that pretrained transformers can already implement the causal state transitions of strongly-typed languages. But what about more complex compositional reasoning?

The key insight is that causal states in Haskell have a natural compositional structure through:
1. **Type constructors** (List, Maybe, Either)
2. **Higher-order functions** (map, fold, filter)
3. **Type classes** (Functor, Monad, Applicative)

These create a rich algebraic structure in the causal state space that supports powerful abstractions. Evidence suggests that current models can navigate simple cases of this structure, but struggle with higher-order composition and complex type classes.

## Conclusion: From Type Theory to Agent Theory

The correspondence between causal states and types in Haskell provides a rigorous foundation for understanding LLM agents. If we view agent behavior as navigation through a causal state space, then strongly-typed languages give us a controlled environment where:

1. We know the ground truth causal states (types)
2. We can verify the model's understanding through type checking
3. We can study composition, abstraction, and generalization formally

This suggests a path forward: by training on execution traces of strongly-typed languages and explicitly modeling the causal state transitions, we can develop agents with more reliable, verifiable behavior and stronger compositional abilities.

The transformer's ability to approximate these causal states, even imperfectly, explains their surprising effectiveness as function-calling agents and points to their potential as even more powerful reasoning systems when properly trained on structured execution traces.
