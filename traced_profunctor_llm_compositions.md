    ## Introduction

    Our previous work introduced a framework for composing functions implemented by Large Language Models (LLMs) using **profunctor optics**, bridging functional programming principles with the capabilities of LLMs. While this framework allowed for type-safe composition of LLM functions, it did not fully capture the way modern LLM architectures, particularly transformers, process information using attention mechanisms.

    In transformer architectures, each computation step can access the entire history of previous computations through self-attention, enabling the model to consider all prior inputs and outputs when generating the next token. To accurately model this behavior, we extend our framework to incorporate **traced profunctors**, which allow for "looping back" and accessing previous states in the computation.

    This enhanced framework provides a more complete theoretical foundation for understanding LLM computation, aligning closely with the actual mechanisms used in transformers. It offers improved modeling of how LLMs process information and enables more powerful and flexible function composition.

    ---

    ## Theoretical Foundations

    ### 2.1 Initial Insights

    Our journey began with integrating insights from two key theoretical frameworks:

    1. **Profunctor Optics for LLM Function Composition**: This framework uses profunctors to model the composition of functions implemented by LLMs, addressing challenges such as type mismatches and schema variations.

    2. **Typed Processes and Causal States**: This theory explains how LLMs develop abstract computational abilities through the emergence of causal states based on predictive equivalence classes.

    The realization that LLMs implicitly implement compositions of functions through their internal state transitions led us to model these transitions using profunctor optics.

    ### 2.2 Core Theoretical Elements

    #### 2.2.1 Profunctors

    A **profunctor** is a generalization of a function that is contravariant in its input and covariant in its output:

    ```haskell
    class Profunctor p where
    dimap :: (a' -> a) -> (b -> b') -> p a b -> p a' b'
    ```

    Profunctors are powerful tools for modeling bidirectional data transformations, suitable for composing functions over complex data types.

    #### 2.2.2 Traced Profunctors

    To model the ability of functions to access their computation history, we introduce **traced profunctors**. In traced monoidal categories, morphisms can "loop back" to previous states, allowing each transformation to utilize the full history of computations.

    This concept aligns with the attention mechanism in transformers, where each token attends to all previous tokens.

    #### 2.2.3 Causal States and Typed Processes

    **Causal states** are equivalence classes of histories leading to identical predictive futures. They serve as types in our framework, capturing all relevant information for prediction.

    **Typed Processes** assign types to each history based on causal states, providing a mathematical foundation for understanding how statistical prediction leads to abstract computation.

    #### 2.2.4 Type Safety in LLM Compositions

    Ensuring type safety is crucial when composing LLM functions:

    - **Schema Validation**: Defining input and output types using JSON schemas.
    - **Type Mappings**: Implementing mappings between different types.
    - **Profunctor Composition**: Using profunctor optics to adapt types during function composition.

    By integrating profunctors and traced profunctors with causal states, we can model LLMs' internal computations in a type-safe manner.

    ---

    ## Extending the Framework with Traced Profunctors

    ### 3.1 Limitations of Simple Profunctor Composition

    Our original framework allowed for linear composition of functions:

    ```haskell
    f >>> g >>> h
    ```

    However, this linear approach fails to capture how LLMs, particularly transformers, process information. Transformers utilize attention mechanisms that enable each computation step to access all previous inputs and outputs.

    ### 3.2 Introduction to Traced Monoidal Categories

    **Traced monoidal categories** extend monoidal categories by allowing morphisms to have feedback loops. In our context, this means each function can access and incorporate information from previous computations.

    **Traced Profunctors**:

    ```haskell
    data TracedProfunctor p where
    Traced :: {
        forward :: p a b,
        trace   :: Context -> a,
        context :: Context
    }
    ```

    - **`forward`**: The forward transformation.
    - **`trace`**: Function accessing the context (history).
    - **`context`**: The accumulated history of computations.

    ### 3.3 Formal Definition of Traced Profunctors for LLMs

    #### Core Structures

    - **Context**: Represents the complete history of computations.

    ```haskell
    data Context = Context {
        inputs  :: [(TypeId, Any)],
        outputs :: [(TypeId, Any)],
        steps   :: [ComputationStep]
    }
    ```

    - **ComputationStep**: A single computation step in the history.

    ```haskell
    data ComputationStep = Step {
        input_type       :: Type,
        output_type      :: Type,
        transform        :: TracedTransform,
        attention_pattern :: AttentionPattern
    }
    ```

    - **AttentionPattern**: Defines how a computation step attends to previous computations.

    ```haskell
    data AttentionPattern = AttentionPattern {
        input_attention  :: [Float],  -- Weights for previous inputs
        output_attention :: [Float],  -- Weights for previous outputs
        cross_attention  :: Matrix    -- Cross-attention between inputs and outputs
    }
    ```

    #### Traced Composition

    The composition of traced profunctors involves combining their forward transformations and merging their contexts:

    ```haskell
    compose :: TracedProfunctor p => p a b -> p b c -> p a c
    compose f g = Traced {
    forward = composeProfunctors f.forward g.forward,
    trace   = \ctx ->
        let history   = collectHistory ctx
            attention = computeAttention history
        in applyAttention attention history,
    context = mergeContexts f.context g.context
    }
    ```

    ---

    ## Connection to Transformer Attention Mechanisms

    ### 4.1 Mapping Traced Profunctors to Transformers

    The traced profunctor framework maps naturally to the attention mechanisms in transformer architectures.

    **Transformer Block Example**:

    ```python
    class TracedTransformerBlock:
        def forward(self, current_input: Tensor, context: Context) -> Tensor:
            # Collect previous states
            previous_states = context.collect_states()
            
            # Compute attention scores
            attention_scores = self.attention(
                query=current_input,
                keys=previous_states,
                values=previous_states
            )
            
            # Apply attention
            attended = self.apply_attention(attention_scores, previous_states)
            
            # Forward transformation
            return self.transform(torch.cat([current_input, attended]))
    ```

    - **Context Access**: The block accesses the `context` to retrieve previous states.
    - **Attention Mechanism**: Computes attention scores and applies them to previous states.
    - **Transformation**: Combines the current input with attended information.

    ### 4.2 Mathematical Correspondence

    The transformer's attention mechanism:

    \[
    \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
    \]

    Corresponds to the traced profunctor's trace access:

    ```haskell
    traceAccess :: Context -> Input -> Output
    traceAccess ctx input = 
    let attention       = computeAttentionWeights input ctx
        weightedHistory = applyWeights attention ctx
    in transform (input <> weightedHistory)
    ```

    - **Query (`Q`)**: The current input.
    - **Keys (`K`)** and **Values (`V`)**: Previous states from the context.
    - **Attention Weights**: Computed based on the similarity between the query and keys.
    - **Transformation**: Applies the attention-weighted history to enhance the current computation.

    ---

    ## Implementation Details

    ### 5.1 Implementing Traced Profunctor Transforms

    We implement traced profunctor transforms in practice using classes that encapsulate the forward transformation, attention patterns, and type mappings.

    ```python
    class TracedProfunctorTransform:
        def __init__(self, forward: Callable, attention: AttentionPattern, type_mapping: TypeMapping):
            self.forward = forward
            self.attention = attention
            self.type_mapping = type_mapping
        
        def apply(self, input: Any, context: Context) -> Any:
            # Get relevant history through attention
            history = self.attention.attend(context)
            
            # Apply forward transformation with history
            return self.forward(input, history)
        
        def compose(self, other: 'TracedProfunctorTransform') -> 'TracedProfunctorTransform':
            # Compose transforms while preserving traces
            return TracedProfunctorTransform(
                forward=compose_forwards(self.forward, other.forward),
                attention=merge_attention(self.attention, other.attention),
                type_mapping=compose_types(self.type_mapping, other.type_mapping)
            )
    ```

    - **`apply` Method**: Executes the transformation using the current input and attended history.
    - **`compose` Method**: Combines two traced profunctor transforms, merging their attention patterns and type mappings.

    ### 5.2 Attention Pattern Implementation

    The `AttentionPattern` class defines how attention weights are computed and applied to the context.

    ```python
    class AttentionPattern:
        def attend(self, context: Context) -> AttendedContext:
            # Compute attention weights
            weights = self.compute_weights(context)
            
            # Apply attention to history
            attended_inputs = self.attend_inputs(weights.input_weights, context.inputs)
            attended_outputs = self.attend_outputs(weights.output_weights, context.outputs)
            
            return AttendedContext(inputs=attended_inputs, outputs=attended_outputs)
        
        def compute_weights(self, context: Context) -> AttentionWeights:
            # Implement attention weight computation
            pass
    ```

    - **`attend` Method**: Computes attention over the context and returns the attended inputs and outputs.
    - **`compute_weights` Method**: Calculates the attention weights based on the current input and context.

    ## Theoretical Implications

    ### 6.1 Universal Properties of the Framework

    By incorporating traced profunctors, our framework gains several universal properties:

    1. **Completeness**: Every transformer-style attention pattern can be expressed as a traced profunctor composition.

    2. **Type Safety**: The framework maintains type safety even with arbitrary attention patterns, ensuring that compositions are valid.

    ```haskell
    compose :: TracedProfunctor p => (Context -> Type a -> Type b) -> (Context -> Type b -> Type c) -> (Context -> Type a -> Type c)
    ```

    3. **Compositionality**: Attention patterns themselves compose in well-defined ways, allowing for complex and flexible function compositions.

    ### 6.2 Relationship to Traditional Profunctors

    Traced profunctors generalize traditional profunctors by adding:

    - **Context Awareness**: Access to the entire computation history.
    - **History Access through Attention**: Ability to attend to previous inputs and outputs.
    - **Cross-Step Information Flow**: Information can flow across different steps in the computation, not just sequentially.

    This enhancement allows the framework to model the behavior of transformers more accurately.

    ## Practical Examples and Case Studies

    ### 7.1 Composing LLM Functions with Traced Profunctors

    **Example Scenario**:

    - **Function A**: Processes input text and generates intermediate representations.
    - **Function B**: Takes the output of Function A and further processes it, while also attending to the original input and previous outputs.

    **Implementation Using Traced Profunctors**:

    1. **Define Traced Profunctor Transforms**:

    ```python
    function_A = TracedProfunctorTransform(
        forward=forward_A,
        attention=attention_A,
        type_mapping=type_mapping_A
    )
    
    function_B = TracedProfunctorTransform(
        forward=forward_B,
        attention=attention_B,
        type_mapping=type_mapping_B
    )
    ```

    2. **Compose Functions**:

    ```python
    composed_function = function_A.compose(function_B)
    ```

    3. **Execute Composition with Context**:

    ```python
    context = Context()
    input_data = ...

    # Apply composed function
    result = composed_function.apply(input_data, context)
    ```

    - **Attention Patterns**: Each function's attention pattern specifies how it attends to the context.
    - **Context Updates**: After each function application, the context is updated with new inputs and outputs.

    ### 7.2 Advanced Composition Patterns

    **Higher-Order Traced Profunctors**:

    - **Definition**: Traced profunctors that operate on other profunctors, enabling more complex transformations and compositions.

    **Isomorphisms and Bidirectional Transformations**:

    - **Isomorphisms**: Reversible transformations between types, allowing data to be converted back and forth without loss.
    - **Application**: Useful when different functions expect data in different formats but represent the same underlying information.

    ## Future Directions

    ### 8.1 Implementation Extensions

    - **Enhanced Attention Mechanisms**: Incorporate more sophisticated attention patterns, such as multi-head attention or dynamic attention weights.
    - **Optimization Techniques**: Explore methods to optimize the performance of traced profunctor compositions, including caching and parallelization.
    - **Integration with Existing Frameworks**: Adapt the framework to work with popular deep learning libraries and tools.

    ### 8.2 Theoretical Developments

    - **Formal Proofs**: Establish rigorous proofs of the framework's properties, such as completeness and type safety.
    - **Categorical Semantics**: Deepen the connection to category theory, exploring how traced monoidal categories relate to LLM computations.
    - **Exploration of Emergent Patterns**: Investigate patterns that emerge from composing functions using traced profunctors and their implications for understanding LLM behavior.

    ---

    ## Conclusion

    By incorporating **traced profunctors** into our framework, we have significantly enhanced our ability to model and understand the computation processes of Large Language Models, particularly those based on transformer architectures. This extended framework aligns closely with the attention mechanisms used in transformers, capturing the ability of functions to access and utilize the full history of computations.

    **Key Achievements**:

    - **Accurate Modeling of LLM Computation**: The framework now mirrors the way transformers process information, providing a more realistic theoretical foundation.
    - **Type Safety and Composability**: Maintains rigorous type safety even with complex attention patterns, enabling flexible and reliable function composition.
    - **Bridging Theory and Practice**: Connects advanced theoretical concepts from category theory and functional programming with practical implementations in machine learning.

    **Future Impact**:

    - **Research Advancements**: Offers a solid foundation for future research into the theoretical aspects of LLMs and their computation models.
    - **Practical Applications**: Enhances the development of intelligent systems that leverage LLM capabilities while maintaining formal guarantees about their behavior.

    By updating our paper to include these concepts, we provide a more complete and robust framework that advances our understanding of LLM function composition and opens new avenues for innovation in both theoretical and practical domains.

    **Note**: This enhanced document integrates the concepts introduced in the "Traced Profunctors and Attention: A Unified View of LLM Computation" into our previous framework. By extending our theoretical foundations and practical implementations to include traced profunctors, we have developed a more accurate and powerful model for composing functions implemented by LLMs. This updated framework captures the essential features of transformer architectures and provides valuable insights for future research and development.
