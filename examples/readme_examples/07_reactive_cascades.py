Example 07: Reactive Cascades with Event-Driven Patterns

This example demonstrates the event-driven reactive pattern from the README:
- Event-driven cascading transformations using @on decorators
- Automatic batching based on event triggers
- Emergent workflow coordination without central control
- Map-reduce pattern through events
- Self-organizing work distribution

This matches the README section "Multi-step reactive cascades" (lines 295-362).
