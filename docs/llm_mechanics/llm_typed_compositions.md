# Composing Haskell-like Programs with Structured Types, JSON Schemas, and Constrained LLM Decoding

Function composition is a foundational concept in functional programming, allowing developers to build complex operations by combining simpler functions. In languages like Haskell, composing functions with basic types is straightforward. However, when functions involve structured or nested data types, the composition becomes more intricate. Simultaneously, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 introduces new possibilities for code generation but also presents challenges in ensuring type safety and adherence to predefined structures.

This comprehensive noteset explores the intersection of these domains: composing Haskell-like programs defined by structured types, utilizing JSON schemas for type definitions, and employing constrained LLM decoding to ensure type-safe code generation. We delve into theoretical underpinnings from category theory and type theory, practical functional programming paradigms, and advanced techniques in LLM decoding. Through detailed explanations and examples, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of how these concepts integrate to produce reliable and type-safe code.

## Introduction

Functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions. One of its core concepts is **function composition**, where complex functions are built by combining simpler ones. This approach promotes modularity, reusability, and ease of reasoning about code.

In languages like Haskell, function composition with basic types is straightforward. However, as software systems grow in complexity, functions often need to operate on structured or nested data types, such as records, tuples, or custom data structures. Composing functions in these contexts introduces challenges in accessing, updating, and ensuring type safety of the data.

Simultaneously, **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating code, translating languages, and assisting in software development. Yet, generating code that is type-safe and adheres to specific data structures remains a challenge. Incorporating **JSON schemas** and **constrained decoding techniques** can guide LLMs to produce code that not only compiles but also aligns with the intended data models and type constraints.

This noteset aims to explore the synergy between function composition in Haskell with structured types and the utilization of LLMs for type-safe code generation. We will delve into theoretical foundations, practical implementation patterns, and advanced techniques to achieve reliable and maintainable code in functional programming.

## Function Composition in Haskell

### Basic Function Composition

In Haskell, functions are first-class citizens and can be composed using the `(.)` operator. Function composition allows developers to create new functions by combining existing ones, where the output of one function becomes the input of another.

**Example:**

```haskell
f :: B -> C
g :: A -> B
h :: A -> C
h = f . g
```

In this example:

- `f` is a function that takes an input of type `B` and produces an output of type `C`.
- `g` takes an input of type `A` and produces an output of type `B`.
- `h` is the composition of `f` and `g`, resulting in a function from `A` to `C`.

Function composition is associative, meaning that the grouping of functions does not affect the outcome:

```haskell
(f . g) . h = f . (g . h)
```

### Composition with Structured Data Types

When functions involve structured or nested data types, such as records or tuples, the composition becomes more complex. Consider the following functions:

```haskell
f :: { x :: B1, y :: B2 } -> C
g :: A -> { x :: B1, y :: B2 }
```

Here, `f` expects a record with fields `x` and `y`, and `g` produces such a record from an input of type `A`. Directly composing `f` and `g` isn't as straightforward as with basic types because of the need to handle the structured data properly.

To compose these functions, we need mechanisms to:

- Access and manipulate fields within structured data types.
- Ensure that the composition respects the types and structures involved.
- Maintain type safety throughout the composition process.

This requires a deeper understanding of how functions interact with structured data and the development of tools or abstractions to facilitate such compositions.

---

## Challenges with Structured Data Types

Structured data types introduce several challenges when composing functions:

1. **Accessing Nested Data:**
   - Navigating through nested structures (e.g., records within records) requires additional logic.
   - Extracting and updating specific fields can become cumbersome without proper abstractions.

2. **Immutable Data Updates:**
   - Functional programming emphasizes immutability, meaning data structures cannot be modified after creation.
   - Updating a field within a nested structure involves creating a new structure with the updated value, which can be verbose and error-prone.

3. **Type Safety:**
   - Ensuring that functions operating on structured data maintain type correctness is crucial.
   - Type mismatches can lead to compile-time errors or unexpected behaviors.

4. **Composable Abstractions:**
   - Developing reusable and composable patterns for manipulating structured data helps manage complexity.
   - Abstractions like lenses and optics provide mechanisms to compose functions that operate on parts of a structure.

5. **Code Maintainability:**
   - As codebases grow, maintaining and understanding code that manipulates complex structures becomes challenging.
   - Clear and concise abstractions improve readability and reduce the likelihood of bugs.

Addressing these challenges requires both theoretical understanding and practical tools to work effectively with structured data in function composition.

## Theoretical Foundations

Understanding the theoretical concepts behind function composition with structured data types provides a solid foundation for practical applications. Key areas include **category theory**, **lenses and optics**, and **profunctor optics**.

### Category Theory Concepts

**Category Theory** is a branch of mathematics that deals with abstract structures and the relationships between them. It provides a high-level framework to reason about mathematical concepts, including function composition.

In category theory:

- **Categories** consist of objects and morphisms (arrows) between objects.
- **Objects** can represent types or data structures.
- **Morphisms** represent functions or transformations from one object to another.
- **Composition Laws** ensure that morphisms can be composed associatively and that each object has an identity morphism.

**Composition Laws:**

1. **Associativity:**

   \[
   (f \circ g) \circ h = f \circ (g \circ h)
   \]

   This means that the way functions are grouped during composition does not affect the outcome.

2. **Identity:**

   There exists an identity morphism `id` for each object such that:

   \[
   f \circ id = f \quad \text{and} \quad id \circ f = f
   \]

In the context of structured types:

- **Objects:** Represent data types, including structured types like records, tuples, or custom data structures.
- **Morphisms:** Represent functions that transform one type into another.
- **Product Categories:** Model structured types as products of their constituent types (e.g., a record as a product of its fields).

**Example:**

Consider types `A`, `B`, and `C`, and functions `f :: B -> C` and `g :: A -> B`. In category theory, these functions are morphisms between the objects `A`, `B`, and `C`.

### Lenses and Optics

**Lenses** are composable abstractions that provide a way to focus on parts of a data structure. They allow for accessing (getting) and updating (setting) nested data in a functional and immutable manner.

A lens can be thought of as a pair of functions:

- **Getter:** Extracts a part of a data structure.
- **Setter:** Produces a new data structure with a modified part.

**Lens Definition:**

In Haskell, a lens can be defined as:

```haskell
type Lens s t a b = forall f. Functor f => (a -> f b) -> s -> f t
```

- `s`: The source data structure.
- `t`: The modified data structure after an update.
- `a`: The part of the structure we're focusing on.
- `b`: The updated part.

**Benefits of Lenses:**

- **Composable Access:** Lenses can be composed to focus on deeply nested parts of a structure.
- **Immutable Updates:** They allow updating parts of an immutable data structure without modifying the original.
- **Code Reusability:** Lenses can be reused across different parts of the codebase, improving modularity.
- **Enhanced Readability:** They provide a clear and concise way to work with nested data.

**Example:**

Suppose we have the following data structures:

```haskell
data Address = Address { street :: String, city :: String }
data Person = Person { name :: String, address :: Address }
```

We can define lenses to focus on the `city` field within the `Address` inside `Person`:

```haskell
import Control.Lens

addressLens :: Lens' Person Address
addressLens = lens address (\person newAddress -> person { address = newAddress })

cityLens :: Lens' Address String
cityLens = lens city (\addr newCity -> addr { city = newCity })

-- Composed lens to focus on the city within a Person
personCityLens :: Lens' Person String
personCityLens = addressLens . cityLens
```

Using `personCityLens`, we can access or update the city in a `Person` object:

```haskell
getCity :: Person -> String
getCity = view personCityLens

setCity :: String -> Person -> Person
setCity = set personCityLens
```

### Profunctor Optics

**Profunctor Optics** generalize lenses and other optical structures using the concept of profunctors. A **profunctor** is a type constructor `p` that is contravariant in its first argument and covariant in its second.

**Profunctor Definition:**

```haskell
class Profunctor p where
    dimap :: (a' -> a) -> (b -> b') -> p a b -> p a' b'
```

- `dimap` allows transforming both the input and output types of the profunctor.

**Strong Profunctors:**

To work with lenses, we need **strong profunctors**, which provide additional operations:

```haskell
class Profunctor p => Strong p where
    first' :: p a b -> p (a, c) (b, c)
    second' :: p a b -> p (c, a) (c, b)
```

**Profunctor Lenses:**

Using profunctors, a lens can be defined as:

```haskell
type LensP s t a b = forall p. Strong p => p a b -> p s t
```

**Advantages of Profunctor Optics:**

- **Generalization:** Profunctor optics encompass lenses, prisms, traversals, and other optics.
- **Enhanced Composability:** They allow composing different types of optics seamlessly.
- **Strong Typing:** Provide strong static typing guarantees, ensuring correctness at compile time.
- **Flexibility:** Enable more complex data transformations that are not possible with traditional lenses.

**Example:**

Defining a profunctor lens for the `city` field:

```haskell
import Data.Profunctor

cityLensP :: LensP Address Address String String
cityLensP = dimap (\addr -> (city addr, addr)) (\(newCity, addr) -> addr { city = newCity }) . first'
```

---

## Practical Implementation Patterns

Applying the theoretical concepts to practical code involves developing patterns and strategies that facilitate working with structured data and function composition.

### Using Lenses for Structured Data

**Defining Lenses:**

For each field in a data structure, we can define a lens:

```haskell
-- For Person
nameLens :: Lens' Person String
nameLens = lens name (\person newName -> person { name = newName })

addressLens :: Lens' Person Address
addressLens = lens address (\person newAddress -> person { address = newAddress })

-- For Address
streetLens :: Lens' Address String
streetLens = lens street (\addr newStreet -> addr { street = newStreet })

cityLens :: Lens' Address String
cityLens = lens city (\addr newCity -> addr { city = newCity })
```

**Composing Lenses:**

We can compose lenses to focus on nested fields:

```haskell
personCityLens :: Lens' Person String
personCityLens = addressLens . cityLens
```

**Using Lenses:**

- **Accessing Data:**

  ```haskell
  getPersonCity :: Person -> String
  getPersonCity = view personCityLens
  ```

- **Updating Data:**

  ```haskell
  setPersonCity :: String -> Person -> Person
  setPersonCity = set personCityLens

  updatePersonCity :: (String -> String) -> Person -> Person
  updatePersonCity = over personCityLens
  ```

- **Example Usage:**

  ```haskell
  let person = Person { name = "Alice", address = Address { street = "123 Maple St", city = "Springfield" } }
  let newPerson = setPersonCity "Shelbyville" person
  ```

**Benefits:**

- Simplifies code for accessing and updating nested data.
- Reduces boilerplate code associated with immutable updates.
- Enhances code readability and maintainability.

### Functorial Mapping and Applicatives

**Functors** and **applicatives** provide mechanisms to apply functions over wrapped values or within contexts, preserving the structure.

**Functor:**

A **functor** is a type class that implements the `fmap` function, allowing a function to be applied over a wrapped value.

```haskell
class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

**Example with Maybe:**

```haskell
instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap _ Nothing  = Nothing
    fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
```

**Applicative:**

An **applicative** is a functor with additional capabilities, allowing functions that are themselves wrapped in a context to be applied to wrapped values.

```haskell
class Functor f => Applicative f where
    pure  :: a -> f a
    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

**Example Usage:**

Suppose we have a list of `Person` objects and want to increment the age of each person.

```haskell
incrementAges :: [Person] -> [Person]
incrementAges = fmap (\p -> p { age = age p + 1 })
```

Here, we use `fmap` to apply the function to each element in the list, preserving the list structure.

### Ensuring Type Safety

Type safety is crucial in functional programming, ensuring that functions behave as expected at compile time. Haskell's strong static type system helps catch errors early in the development process.

**Strategies for Type Safety:**

1. **Explicit Type Annotations:**

   Always specify the types of functions and data structures. This makes the code more readable and helps the compiler catch type mismatches.

   ```haskell
   incrementAge :: Person -> Person
   ```

2. **Type Constraints:**

   Use type constraints to enforce that functions operate on expected types.

   ```haskell
   incrementAge :: Num a => Person a -> Person a
   ```

3. **Phantom Types:**

   Phantom types are type parameters that are not used in the data constructors but carry additional type information.

   ```haskell
   data SafeNumber a = SafeNumber { getNumber :: Int }

   -- 'a' is a phantom type parameter
   ```

4. **Newtype Wrappers:**

   Use `newtype` to create distinct types from existing ones, enhancing type safety without runtime overhead.

   ```haskell
   newtype UserId = UserId Int
   ```

5. **Algebraic Data Types (ADTs):**

   Use ADTs to model data with multiple constructors, ensuring that all possible cases are handled.

   ```haskell
   data Shape = Circle Double | Rectangle Double Double
   ```

**Example:**

Creating a safe function composition wrapper:

```haskell
newtype SafeFunction a b = SafeFunction { runFunction :: a -> b }

instance Category SafeFunction where
    id = SafeFunction id
    (SafeFunction f) . (SafeFunction g) = SafeFunction (f . g)
```

By using `SafeFunction`, we can ensure that only functions with compatible types are composed, preventing runtime errors.

## Type-Safe Code Generation with LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown impressive capabilities in generating code. However, ensuring that the generated code is type-safe and adheres to specific data structures remains a challenge.

### LLMs and Code Generation Challenges

**Common Challenges:**

1. **Type Safety:**

   - Generated code may not respect type constraints or may contain type errors.
   - LLMs might not correctly infer types without explicit guidance.

2. **Complex Data Structures:**

   - Handling nested or recursive data types can be difficult for LLMs.
   - Maintaining consistency in data structures throughout the generated code.

3. **Consistency and Scope:**

   - Variable naming and scoping can be inconsistent.
   - Functions might reference undefined variables or functions.

4. **Adherence to Specifications:**

   - LLMs may deviate from the specified requirements or introduce unintended behavior.
   - Without proper constraints, the generated code may not meet the desired functionality.

### Leveraging JSON Schemas

**JSON Schema** is a powerful tool for validating the structure of JSON data. By incorporating JSON schemas into code generation, we can guide LLMs to produce code that adheres to specified data structures.

**Benefits of Using JSON Schemas:**

- **Language-Agnostic Definitions:**

  JSON schemas provide a standard way to define data structures independent of programming languages.

- **Guidance for LLMs:**

  Including schemas in prompts helps LLMs understand the expected data structures and constraints.

- **Validation:**

  Generated code or data can be validated against the schema to ensure correctness.

- **Clarity:**

  Schemas make the expected inputs and outputs explicit, reducing ambiguity.

**Example JSON Schema for `Person`:**

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "age": { "type": "integer" },
    "address": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "street": { "type": "string" },
        "city": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["street", "city"]
    }
  },
  "required": ["name", "age", "address"]
}
```

### Constrained LLM Decoding Techniques

Constrained decoding refers to guiding the LLM to produce outputs that satisfy specific constraints, such as adhering to a schema or a set of rules.

**Techniques for Constrained Decoding:**

1. **Schema-Guided Decoding:**

   - Incorporate the JSON schema into the prompt.
   - The LLM uses the schema to generate code that matches the specified structure.

2. **Grammar-Based Constraints:**

   - Define a formal grammar that the output must conform to.
   - Use parsing algorithms to ensure the generated text adheres to the grammar.

3. **Token-Level Constraints:**

   - Restrict the vocabulary at each decoding step to permissible tokens.
   - Use beam search or other decoding strategies with constraints.

4. **Post-Processing Validation:**

   - Validate the generated code against the schema or type system.
   - Provide feedback to the LLM to correct errors.

5. **Interactive Refinement:**

   - Engage in a dialogue with the LLM, refining the code iteratively.
   - Use prompts that correct or adjust previous outputs.

**Benefits of Constrained Decoding:**

- **Type Safety:**

  Ensures that the generated code respects type constraints and structures.

- **Reduced Errors:**

  Minimizes syntactic and semantic errors in the generated code.

- **Customization:**

  Allows tailoring the output to specific requirements and standards.

---

## Integrating Structured Types into LLM Prompts

Effectively integrating structured types and schemas into LLM prompts can significantly enhance the quality and correctness of the generated code.

### Schema-Guided Code Generation

By providing the LLM with explicit schemas and clear instructions, we can guide it to generate code that adheres to the desired structures and functionality.

**Prompt Design:**

- **Include the Schema:**

  Present the JSON schema directly in the prompt.

- **Specify the Task:**

  Clearly state what the code should do, including any specific functions or behaviors.

- **Provide Context:**

  Give examples or additional information that helps the LLM understand the requirements.

**Example Prompt:**

```
You are to generate Haskell code based on the following JSON schema:

[Include JSON Schema]

Define the data types in Haskell that correspond to this schema. Then, write a function `incrementAge` that takes a `Person` and returns a new `Person` with the `age` incremented by 1.
```

**Expected Output:**

```haskell
-- Data Types
data Address = Address { street :: String, city :: String } deriving (Show, Eq)
data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int, address :: Address } deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Function to increment age
incrementAge :: Person -> Person
incrementAge person = person { age = age person + 1 }
```

### Examples and Case Studies

**Case Study 1: Validating User Input**

**Prompt:**

```
Using the following JSON schema for a `User`:

[Include User JSON Schema]

Write Haskell code that defines the corresponding data types and a function `validateUser` that checks if a given JSON object conforms to the schema.
```

**LLM Output:**

```haskell
import Data.Aeson
import Data.Aeson.Types
import Control.Monad (mzero)

-- Data Types
data User = User { username :: String, email :: String } deriving (Show, Eq)

-- FromJSON Instance
instance FromJSON User where
    parseJSON (Object v) = User <$> v .: "username" <*> v .: "email"
    parseJSON _ = mzero

-- Validation Function
validateUser :: Value -> Either String User
validateUser = parseEither parseJSON
```

**Case Study 2: Complex Data Transformations**

**Prompt:**

```
Given the following JSON schema for a `Transaction`:

[Include Transaction JSON Schema]

Write Haskell code that defines the data types and a function `processTransaction` that applies a 10% discount if the `amount` exceeds $1000.
```

**LLM Output:**

```haskell
-- Data Types
data Transaction = Transaction { amount :: Double, description :: String } deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Function to process transaction
processTransaction :: Transaction -> Transaction
processTransaction txn
    | amount txn > 1000 = txn { amount = amount txn * 0.9 }
    | otherwise = txn
```

---

## Advanced Techniques in Constrained Decoding

To further enhance the reliability of LLM-generated code, advanced techniques in constrained decoding can be employed.

### Grammar-Based Constraints

Defining a formal grammar that specifies the syntax and structure of the desired code can help ensure that the generated code is syntactically correct.

**Steps:**

1. **Define the Grammar:**

   Use a context-free grammar (CFG) to define the syntax of the target language or code structure.

2. **Incorporate the Grammar into the LLM:**

   Modify the decoding process to generate outputs that conform to the grammar.

3. **Use Parsing Algorithms:**

   Employ parsing algorithms to validate and enforce the grammar constraints during generation.

**Example:**

- **Define a BNF Grammar** for Haskell function definitions, including data types, function signatures, and expressions.
- **Constrained Decoding:** Modify the LLM's decoding algorithm to only produce tokens that lead to valid productions in the grammar.

### Runtime Validation and Feedback

Incorporating runtime validation to check the generated code can provide immediate feedback and allow for iterative refinement.

**Process:**

1. **Generate Code:**

   The LLM produces an initial version of the code based on the prompt.

2. **Validate Code:**

   - **Compilation:** Attempt to compile the generated code.
   - **Type Checking:** Use Haskell's type checker to identify type errors.
   - **Static Analysis:** Perform static analysis to detect potential issues.

3. **Provide Feedback:**

   - Communicate any errors or warnings back to the LLM.
   - Include specific error messages or line numbers.

4. **Refine Code:**

   - Adjust the prompt or provide additional instructions.
   - The LLM generates a corrected version of the code.

**Benefits:**

- **Error Correction:**

  Allows the LLM to correct mistakes based on concrete feedback.

- **Improved Accuracy:**

  Iterative refinement leads to higher-quality code.

- **Learning Loop:**

  The LLM can learn from the feedback to avoid similar mistakes.

**Example Workflow:**

- **First Attempt:**

  The LLM generates code that fails to compile due to a type mismatch.

- **Feedback:**

  "Error: Expected type `Int`, but found type `String` in function `incrementAge`."

- **Refined Prompt:**

  "Ensure that the `age` field is of type `Int` and that arithmetic operations are correctly applied."

- **Second Attempt:**

  The LLM generates corrected code that compiles successfully.

---

## Conclusion

Composing Haskell-like programs with structured types involves navigating the complexities of accessing, updating, and ensuring type safety of nested data structures. By leveraging theoretical concepts from category theory, lenses, and profunctor optics, developers can create composable and reusable functions that operate on complex data types effectively.

The integration of JSON schemas and constrained decoding techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) offers powerful tools for generating type-safe code. By guiding LLMs through explicit schemas and employing strategies like grammar-based constraints and runtime validation, we can enhance the reliability and correctness of generated code.

Understanding both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation patterns is essential for developers aiming to harness the full potential of functional programming and LLMs in producing robust, maintainable, and type-safe software.
