# Event-Driven Coordination Layer for Entity Component Systems

## Abstract

This document specifies an event-driven coordination layer that complements the Entity Component System (ECS) with its immutable, versioned data substrate. The event system provides a lightweight signaling mechanism that enables reactive computation patterns while maintaining strict separation of concerns between data storage (entities) and computational coordination (events). By introducing a parallel notification system that observes state changes in the entity registry, we enable sophisticated patterns such as cascade computation, hot process detection, and comprehensive execution tracing without compromising the purity of the underlying ECS architecture.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Motivation and Problem Statement

The ECS provides a robust foundation for data management with immutability, versioning, and provenance tracking. However, it lacks a coordination mechanism for:

1. **Reactive Computation**: Automatically triggering computations when their inputs become available
2. **Execution Observability**: Tracking the flow of information through the system
3. **Decoupled Orchestration**: Coordinating complex multi-step processes without tight coupling
4. **Temporal Reasoning**: Understanding the sequence and causality of operations

The event system addresses these needs by introducing a **parallel information flow** that shadows the data flow in the ECS.

### 1.2 Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Events as Pure Signals
Events are lightweight coordination signals that notify about state changes but do not carry entity data. They contain only:
- Unique identifiers (UUIDs) for referencing entities
- Metadata about the type and phase of the change
- Temporal and causal relationships

This ensures events remain transient and do not duplicate the data storage responsibilities of entities.

#### Principle 2: Phase-Based State Transitions
Events progress through well-defined phases that mirror the information lifecycle in the ECS:

```
CONSTRUCTING → VALIDATING → REGISTERING → AVAILABLE → PROCESSING → PROPAGATING
```

Each phase represents a distinct stage in the information transformation pipeline, enabling fine-grained interception and reaction capabilities.

#### Principle 3: Causal Preservation
Events maintain lineage and parent-child relationships, creating a causal graph that parallels the data dependency graph in the ECS. This enables:
- Tracing the provenance of computations
- Understanding cascade effects
- Debugging complex interaction patterns

## 2. Formal Model

### 2.1 Event Structure

An event E is defined as a tuple:

```
E = (id, type, phase, subject, actor, context, timestamp, lineage, parent)
```

Where:
- `id`: UUID - Unique identifier for this event instance
- `type`: EventType - Categorical classification of the event
- `phase`: EventPhase - Current lifecycle stage
- `subject`: UUID - Primary entity or process this event concerns
- `actor`: Optional[UUID] - Entity or process that triggered this event
- `context`: List[UUID] - Additional entities involved
- `timestamp`: DateTime - Temporal ordering
- `lineage`: UUID - Shared identifier across event evolution
- `parent`: Optional[UUID] - Causal parent event

### 2.2 Event Phases for ECS Operations

The event phases map to concrete state transitions in the ECS:

```
EventPhase := {
    CONSTRUCTING,    // Entity assembly in progress
    VALIDATING,      // Type and constraint checking
    REGISTERING,     // Addition to registry
    AVAILABLE,       // Queryable and usable
    BORROWING,       // Data composition occurring
    PROCESSING,      // Function execution active
    VERSIONING,      // New version creation
    PROPAGATING      // Changes flowing through system
}
```

### 2.3 Event Bus Architecture

The Event Bus EB operates as a parallel system to the Entity Registry:

```
EB = (subscribers, handlers, history, emit, subscribe)
```

Where:
- `subscribers`: Map[EventPattern, List[Handler]] - Pattern-based subscriptions
- `handlers`: Map[UUID, EventHandler] - Registered event processors
- `history`: OrderedList[Event] - Temporal event sequence
- `emit`: Event → Event - Broadcast with potential modification
- `subscribe`: EventPattern → Stream[Event] - Filtered event stream

## 3. Integration with ECS

### 3.1 Observing Entity Operations

The event system observes key ECS operations and emits corresponding signals:

```pseudocode
// Entity Creation
when entity.promote_to_root():
    event = Event(
        type: "entity_created",
        phase: REGISTERING,
        subject: entity.ecs_id
    )
    emit(event)
    // ... original operation continues
    event.phase_to(AVAILABLE)

// Function Execution
when CallableRegistry.execute(func, inputs):
    event = Event(
        type: "function_executing",
        phase: CONSTRUCTING,
        subject: func.id,
        context: input_entity_ids
    )
    emit(event)
    // ... execution proceeds
    result = func(inputs)
    event.phase_to(AVAILABLE, context: output_entity_ids)

// Data Borrowing
when entity.borrow_attribute_from(source, field):
    event = Event(
        type: "data_borrowed",
        phase: BORROWING,
        subject: entity.ecs_id,
        actor: source.ecs_id
    )
    emit(event)
```

### 3.2 Enabling Reactive Patterns

The event system enables reactive computation without modifying the ECS:

```pseudocode
// Hot Process Detection
on event(type: "entity_created", phase: AVAILABLE):
    new_type = get_entity_type(event.subject)
    
    for process in all_processes:
        if newly_satisfiable(process, new_type):
            emit(Event(
                type: "process_hot",
                subject: process.id,
                context: [event.subject]
            ))

// Cascade Computation
on event(type: "process_hot"):
    if should_auto_execute(event.subject):
        execute_process(event.subject)
        // This triggers new entity_created events
        // Creating potential cascades
```

## 4. Hypergraph Construction

### 4.1 Execution Hypergraph Model

The event stream enables construction of a hypergraph H representing the complete execution trace:

```
H = (V, E, B, T)
```

Where:
- `V`: Set of vertices (entities)
- `E`: Set of hyperedges (function executions)
- `B`: Set of borrowing edges (data dependencies)
- `T`: Set of temporal edges (version chains)

### 4.2 Incremental Construction

The hypergraph is built incrementally from the event stream:

```pseudocode
class ExecutionHypergraph:
    nodes: Map[UUID, Node]
    hyperedges: Map[UUID, Hyperedge]
    borrowing_edges: List[BorrowingEdge]
    version_chains: Map[UUID, List[UUID]]
    
    on event(type: "entity_created"):
        add_node(event.subject)
    
    on event(type: "function_executed"):
        add_hyperedge(
            inputs: event.context[inputs],
            outputs: event.context[outputs],
            function: event.subject
        )
    
    on event(type: "data_borrowed"):
        add_borrowing_edge(
            from: event.actor,
            to: event.subject,
            field: event.context[0]
        )
    
    on event(type: "entity_versioned"):
        extend_version_chain(
            lineage: event.lineage,
            new_version: event.subject
        )
```

### 4.3 Information Flow Analysis

The hypergraph enables sophisticated analyses:

1. **Reachability**: Which entities can be computed from a given set of inputs
2. **Dependencies**: What must be recomputed if an entity changes
3. **Critical Paths**: Bottlenecks in the computation flow
4. **Information Provenance**: Complete audit trail of data transformations

## 5. Properties and Guarantees

### 5.1 Consistency Properties

**Property 1: Event-Entity Correspondence**
Every entity state change produces exactly one event sequence, ensuring the event log faithfully represents the system evolution.

**Property 2: Causal Consistency**
Event ordering respects causal relationships: if event A causally precedes event B, then timestamp(A) < timestamp(B).

**Property 3: Completeness**
The hypergraph constructed from the event stream contains all entities and their relationships present in the ECS.

### 5.2 Performance Characteristics

**Space Complexity**: O(|E|) where |E| is the number of events
- Events are transient and can be garbage collected after processing
- Only the hypergraph structure needs persistent storage

**Time Complexity**: 
- Event emission: O(|S|) where |S| is the number of subscribers
- Pattern matching: O(1) for exact matches, O(log n) for range queries
- Hypergraph construction: O(1) per event

### 5.3 Decoupling Guarantees

The event system maintains strict decoupling:

1. **Data Independence**: Events never store entity data, only references
2. **Temporal Independence**: Event processing can be asynchronous
3. **Spatial Independence**: Event handlers can execute remotely
4. **Schema Independence**: New event types don't require ECS modifications

## 6. Advanced Patterns

### 6.1 Information Gain Signaling

Events can signal when significant information gains occur:

```pseudocode
on function_execution_complete(execution):
    if execution.output_type not in previous_types:
        emit(Event(
            type: "information_gain",
            subject: execution.id,
            metadata: {
                new_type: execution.output_type,
                entropy_reduction: calculated_reduction
            }
        ))
```

### 6.2 Goal-Directed Coordination

Events enable goal-directed behavior without modifying core ECS:

```pseudocode
class GoalMonitor:
    on event(type: "entity_created"):
        for goal in active_goals:
            if advances_goal(event.subject, goal):
                emit(Event(
                    type: "goal_advanced",
                    subject: goal.id,
                    actor: event.subject
                ))
```

### 6.3 Distributed Execution

Events naturally support distributed systems:

```pseudocode
// Local ECS operations emit events
local_ecs.execute(function) → local_event

// Events can be serialized and transmitted
remote_bus.emit(serialize(local_event))

// Remote systems react to events
remote_handler.on(event) → trigger_computation()
```

## 7. Implementation Considerations

### 7.1 Event Ordering

In distributed settings, ensure causal ordering using:
- Vector clocks for true causality
- Hybrid logical clocks for efficiency
- Total ordering via consensus for critical operations

### 7.2 Event Persistence

While events are conceptually transient, consider:
- Write-ahead logging for recovery
- Event sourcing for audit requirements
- Windowed retention for debugging

### 7.3 Performance Optimization

Key optimizations include:
- Event batching to reduce overhead
- Pattern indexing for efficient matching
- Lazy hypergraph construction for large systems
- Event filtering at source to reduce traffic

## 8. Conclusion

The event-driven coordination layer provides essential reactive capabilities to the ECS while maintaining architectural purity. By treating events as lightweight signals rather than data carriers, we achieve:

1. **Reactive Computation**: Processes trigger automatically as inputs become available
2. **Complete Observability**: Full execution traces via hypergraph construction
3. **Loose Coupling**: Events coordinate without creating dependencies
4. **Extensibility**: New patterns can be added without modifying core systems

This architecture enables sophisticated goal-directed agents and complex computational workflows while preserving the immutability and versioning guarantees of the underlying ECS. The resulting system provides both the robustness of functional data management and the flexibility of reactive event-driven architectures.
