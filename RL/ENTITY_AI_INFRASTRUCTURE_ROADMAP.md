# Entity-First AI Infrastructure Roadmap
Powered by Abstractions framework by Furlat 
(HK3 Mining operations IT)

Massively Parallel RL and conflict resolution by Oscar Goldman (Shogu Heavy Industries, Datamutant, Memoir.id)

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the integration of cutting-edge AI research (GSPO) with the Datamutant error correction and Abstractions entity-first architecture to create a **robust, fault-tolerant, conflict-aware AI infrastructure**. The goal is to transform research implementations into production-ready, entity-managed systems.

## Executive Summary

**What We're Building:**
- **GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization)**: Stable RL training as entity operations
- **Entity-First AI Architecture**: Complete AI lifecycle as managed entities with conflict resolution
- **Entity-Managed AI**: Full AI lifecycle as first-class entities with conflict resolution
- **Robust Training Infrastructure**: Fault-tolerant, conflict-aware AI training systems

**Key Patterns:**
1. **AI Training as Entities**: Training runs, checkpoints, and configurations are entities
2. **Conflict-Protected Training**: Shared model state protected by Pre-ECS + OCC
3. **Entity-Managed Training**: Complete training lifecycle with conflict resolution and event coordination
4. **Event-Driven Coordination**: Reactive AI pipelines with automatic orchestration
5. **Composable Operations**: Hot-swappable AI components via CallableRegistry

## Implementation Guidelines

### Datamutant Integration Principles

1. **Entity-First Design**
   - Everything significant becomes an entity with full lifecycle
   - Use EntityFactory for consistent entity creation
   - Implement proper validation with comprehensive assertions
   - Follow lineage and versioning patterns

2. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**
   - Use `@with_conflict_resolution(pre_ecs=True, occ=True)` for shared state
   - Apply protection to: model training, checkpoint creation, verification queues
   - Most single-entity operations are naturally conflict-free
   - Shared collections/arrays need protection (training batches, model registries)

3. **Event-Driven Coordination**
   - Use `@emit_events` decorator for all significant operations
   - Create parent-child event relationships for workflows
   - Implement reactive handlers with `@on(EventType)`
   - Emit events for: training progress, verification results, failures

4. **Operation Hierarchy**
   - Training operations: `StructuralOperation` with `HIGH` priority
   - Verification operations: `NormalOperation` with `NORMAL` priority
   - Checkpoint operations: `NormalOperation` with `NORMAL` priority
   - Background cleanup: `LowPriorityOperation` with `LOW` priority

5. **Registry Integration**
   - Register all operations in CallableRegistry for composability
   - Use entity trees for complex AI pipeline management
   - Implement hot-swapping capabilities for development iteration
   - Cache frequently accessed entities for performance

### Development Standards

1. **Type Safety**
   - All functions have complete type hints
   - Use Pydantic models for data validation
   - Assert preconditions and postconditions
   - Validate all entity constraints at creation

2. **Error Handling**
   - Define custom exceptions for AI-specific errors
   - Use graceful degradation for non-critical failures
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Log all errors with context for debugging

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for all entity classes and operations
   - Integration tests for cross-system workflows
   - Performance benchmarks vs direct implementations
   - Stress tests for concurrent operation scenarios
   - Property-based testing for entity invariants

4. **Performance Requirements**
   - Entity operations: < 1ms average latency
   - GSPO training overhead: < 10% vs direct implementation
   - TOPLOC verification: < 50ms per proof
   - Memory overhead: < 5% for entity management
   - Event emission: < 0.1ms per event

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Performance Overhead from Entity System**
   - **Risk**: Entity management adds significant latency
   - **Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, lazy loading, profiling-driven optimization
   - **Monitoring**: Continuous performance benchmarking vs baselines

2. **Conflict Resolution Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Complex conflict scenarios cause deadlocks or starvation
   - **Mitigation**: Careful operation ordering, timeout mechanisms, priority inheritance
   - **Monitoring**: Operation queue depth and resolution time metrics

3. **Event System Scalability**
   - **Risk**: High-frequency AI events overwhelm event bus
   - **Mitigation**: Event batching, async processing, circuit breakers
   - **Monitoring**: Event queue depth, processing latency, handler failures

4. **Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Research code integration creates bugs or performance issues
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, gradual rollout, fallback mechanisms
   - **Monitoring**: A/B testing vs direct implementations

### Research Integration Risks

1. **GSPO Implementation Gaps**
   - **Risk**: Research paper vs implementation differences
   - **Mitigation**: Careful validation against paper algorithms, test case verification
   - **Monitoring**: Training convergence metrics, comparison with reference implementation

2. **Byzantine Detection Accuracy**
   - **Risk**: False positives/negatives in Byzantine entity detection
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with simulated malicious entities, threshold tuning
   - **Monitoring**: Detection accuracy metrics, entity trust scores

3. **Algorithm Evolution**
   - **Risk**: Research advances make current implementations obsolete
   - **Mitigation**: Modular design, versioned implementations, migration strategies
   - **Monitoring**: Research tracking, performance comparison with new methods
