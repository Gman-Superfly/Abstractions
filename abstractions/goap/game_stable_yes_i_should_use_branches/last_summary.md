Objective:
The objective of this project was to refactor the existing game.py code into a more modular and structured architecture, separating concerns into different modules such as spatial representation, interactions, input handling, rendering, and payload generation. The goal was to improve code organization, maintainability, and extensibility while preserving the functionality of the original game.py.

Starting State:
The project started with a single game.py file that contained all the game logic, including the grid map, entities, interactions, rendering, and input handling. The code was functional but lacked proper separation of concerns and modularity, making it difficult to maintain and extend.

Initial Bugs:
During the refactoring process, several bugs and issues were encountered:
1. Rendering issues: Only floor tiles were being displayed, and other entities like walls, characters, and items were not visible.
2. Camera positioning: The grid map extended beyond the widget's space, indicating issues with camera positioning and rendering.
3. Camera control: Only the zoom functionality worked, while other camera controls and player movement were not functioning as expected.
4. Effect rendering: Visual effects like path, shadow, raycast, and radius were not being displayed correctly.

Bug Fixes and Lessons Learned:
1. Rendering issues were resolved by properly updating the payload generation and rendering logic to include all entity types and their corresponding sprite mappings.
2. Camera positioning was fixed by correctly constraining the camera position within the bounds of the grid map and adjusting the rendering calculations to map the grid coordinates to the widget's screen coordinates.
3. Camera control and player movement were implemented by handling user input events and generating appropriate action payloads based on the input.
4. Effect rendering was fixed by properly drawing the effects on the widget surface using the correct positioning and visibility checks.

Throughout the process, we learned the importance of modular design, separation of concerns, and proper communication between different components of the game. We also gained insights into handling user input, managing game state, and optimizing rendering performance.

Performance Optimization:
After the initial refactoring and bug fixes, the focus shifted towards optimizing the game's performance to achieve higher frame rates. Several techniques were employed to improve the rendering efficiency and overall performance:

1. Sprite Batching: Sprites were organized into logical groups based on their purpose or layer, and the rendering process was modified to utilize sprite group drawing instead of individual sprite drawing. This reduced the number of draw calls and improved rendering performance.

2. Dirty Rect Rendering: The rendering process was optimized to use dirty rect rendering, where only the changed areas of the screen were updated. This reduced unnecessary drawing and improved performance, especially when the game world was large.

3. Surface Blitting: Frequently blitted surfaces were identified, and their blitting patterns were optimized. The `area` parameter of `pygame.Surface.blit()` was used to specify the specific region to blit, avoiding unnecessary blitting of entire surfaces. Static surfaces were pre-rendered onto larger surfaces to reduce the number of individual blits per frame.

These optimization techniques significantly improved the game's performance, resulting in higher frame rates and smoother gameplay, even with larger grid sizes and more complex game scenarios.

Missing Features and Next Steps:
1. Implement the FOV (Field of View) functionality to limit the visible area based on the character's line of sight.
2. Add interaction mechanisms for picking up items, opening/closing doors, and locking/unlocking doors based on the character's inventory and target entity.
3. Implement the target node/entity widget to display information about the currently targeted entity and its attributes.
4. Utilize the inventory widget to keep track of looted items and update the character's inventory accordingly.
5. Introduce an action widget that displays the available actions for the currently targeted entity, allowing the player to interact with the game world.
6. Enhance the game's procedural generation to create more diverse and interesting dungeon layouts.
7. Implement a save/load system to persist the game state and allow players to resume their progress.
8. Conduct thorough testing and optimization to ensure smooth performance and gameplay experience.
9. Gather feedback from playtests and iterate on the game design and mechanics based on the feedback received.

Next Steps:
1. Prioritize the missing features based on their impact on gameplay and user experience.
2. Break down the tasks into manageable chunks and assign them to team members.
3. Implement the FOV functionality and test its integration with the existing codebase.
4. Design and implement the target node/entity widget, inventory widget, and action widget, ensuring proper communication with the game state and user input.
5. Enhance the procedural generation algorithms to create more diverse and engaging dungeon layouts.
6. Implement the save/load system and test its functionality and reliability.
7. Conduct extensive playtesting sessions to gather feedback and identify any remaining bugs or balance issues.
8. Optimize the game's performance further, focusing on rendering efficiency, memory usage, and scalability.
9. Iterate on the game design and mechanics based on the feedback received, making necessary adjustments and improvements.
10. Prepare the game for release by creating documentation, packaging the game, and setting up distribution channels.
