# Typed Processes: From Next-Token Prediction to Abstract Computation in Large Language Models

## Abstract

We introduce **Typed Processes**, a theoretical framework that elucidates how next-token prediction in language models gives rise to abstract computation through the emergence of types based on predictive equivalence. By leveraging concepts from computational mechanics, particularly ε-machines and causal states, we demonstrate that the natural partitioning of sequences into equivalence classes forms an optimal typing system for abstract computation. We prove that these types are minimal sufficient statistics for prediction and show how modern neural architectures implicitly approximate these abstractions. This work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how statistical prediction can lead to abstract computation, offering insights that extend beyond language models to any system that learns to predict sequential data.

## 1. Introduction

The remarkable capabilities of modern language models, such as GPT-4, have challenged our understanding of the relationship between statistical learning and abstract computation. Despite being trained primarily on next-token prediction tasks, these models exhibit abilities that suggest a form of reasoning and abstraction previously thought to be exclusive to symbolic AI systems.

This phenomenon raises fundamental questions:

- How does statistical learning from data lead to the emergence of abstract computational abilities?
- What underlying structures enable language models to perform tasks that require more than mere pattern recognition?

To address these questions, we propose a unifying framework that connects statistical prediction with abstract computation through the concept of **Typed Processes**. Our key insight is that the causal states of a process—equivalence classes of histories leading to identical predictive futures—naturally form an optimal typing system for computation. This connection bridges the gap between statistical and symbolic approaches to AI.

### 1.1 Bridging Statistical Learning and Abstract Computation

Historically, the fields of statistical learning and symbolic computation have developed along separate paths. Statistical learning focuses on patterns and probabilities derived from data, while symbolic computation emphasizes explicit rules and logical reasoning. The success of language models suggests that these paradigms are reconcilable.

Advancements in **computational mechanics** provide a mathematical framework for discovering structure in stochastic processes through the concept of **ε-machines** and **causal states** [1]. These causal states are minimal sufficient statistics for prediction, capturing all relevant information from the past necessary to predict the future.

Simultaneously, developments in **type theory** offer formal tools for reasoning about computation, particularly in sequential and interactive settings. By integrating these perspectives, we aim to demonstrate how prediction-induced structures can serve as types that facilitate abstract computation.

### 1.2 Overview and Contributions

Our contributions are as follows:

1. **Definition of Typed Processes**: We formalize the notion of typed processes, where types emerge from predictive equivalence classes formed by causal states.

2. **Optimality of Causal States as Types**: We prove that causal states are minimal sufficient statistics for prediction and serve as optimal types for abstract computation.

3. **Connection to Language Models**: We show how modern neural architectures, particularly transformers, implicitly approximate these abstractions through continuous representations.

4. **Practical Implications**: We discuss how this framework explains the emergence of computational abilities in language models and provides principles for designing systems that compute with learned abstractions.

By grounding our framework in established theoretical foundations, we provide a coherent explanation of how statistical prediction can give rise to abstract computation, with implications for understanding natural language processing and designing intelligent systems.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Computational Mechanics and Causal States

**Computational mechanics** is a framework for modeling and analyzing complex systems by identifying patterns and structures within sequences of data [1]. Central to this framework are **ε-machines**, which are unifilar hidden Markov models that represent the minimal causal structure of a stochastic process.

An ε-machine partitions the set of all possible pasts into equivalence classes called **causal states**. Two histories are considered causally equivalent if they lead to the same conditional probability distribution over future observations.

**Definition 1 (Causal Equivalence)**: Two histories \( h_1 \) and \( h_2 \) are causally equivalent if:

$$ P(\overrightarrow{X} | h_1) = P(\overrightarrow{X} | h_2) $$

where \( \overrightarrow{X} \) represents the future sequence of observations.

The set of causal states \( \mathcal{S} \) captures all the predictively relevant information from the past. The transitions between causal states are determined by the observed symbols, and due to unifilarity, the next state is uniquely determined by the current state and the next symbol.

**Key Properties of Causal States**:

- **Predictive Sufficiency**: Causal states retain all information necessary for optimal prediction.
- **Minimality**: They form the minimal sufficient statistics, leading to the smallest possible state space without loss of predictive power.
- **Unifilarity**: The transition between states is deterministic given the current state and next observation.

### 2.2 ε-Transducers and Input-Output Processes

Extending ε-machines to input-output processes leads to **ε-transducers**, which model structured transformations between inputs and outputs [2]. An ε-transducer captures how an input sequence is transformed into an output sequence, preserving the causal structure of the process.

In an ε-transducer, causal states are defined based on joint histories of inputs and outputs. The transitions consider both the input symbol and the generated output symbol, maintaining unifilarity in the combined input-output process.

**Definition 2 (ε-Transducer)**: An ε-transducer is a tuple \( (X, Y, \mathcal{S}, T) \), where:

- \( X \) and \( Y \) are the input and output alphabets.
- \( \mathcal{S} \) is the set of causal states.
- \( T \) represents the transition probabilities conditioned on the input and output symbols.

### 2.3 Synchronization in Finite-State Sources

**Synchronization** refers to the process by which an observer aligns its internal state with the hidden state of a source based on observed outputs. In the context of ε-machines, synchronization is critical for accurate prediction.

Travers and Crutchfield [3] studied synchronization in finite-state sources, distinguishing between **exact synchronization**, where alignment occurs after a finite number of observations, and **asymptotic synchronization**, which requires infinite observations.

**Key Findings**:

- For exact ε-machines, synchronization occurs exponentially fast with respect to the length of observed sequences.
- Synchronization reduces the observer's uncertainty about the system's state, improving predictive accuracy.

These concepts are essential for understanding how language models might rapidly adjust their internal states to align with the structure of the language they process.

### 2.4 Type Theory and Computational Types

**Type theory** provides formal systems for classifying and constraining the behavior of computational processes. In programming languages, types ensure that operations are applied to compatible data, preventing errors.

**Session types** and **linear types** are advanced concepts that manage sequential and interactive computations, ensuring that processes adhere to specified communication protocols.

By viewing causal states as types, we can leverage type theory to reason about the abstract computational capabilities that emerge from statistical prediction.

## 3. From Next-Token Prediction to Typed Processes

### 3.1 Predictive Equivalence and Causal States as Types

In the context of language models, sequences of tokens can be partitioned into equivalence classes based on their predictive futures. Two histories belong to the same class if they lead to the same conditional probability distribution over future tokens.

**Definition 3 (Predictive Equivalence)**: Two histories \( h_1 \) and \( h_2 \) are predictively equivalent if:

$$ P(X_{>t} | h_1) = P(X_{>t} | h_2) $$

These equivalence classes correspond to causal states in computational mechanics and can be interpreted as **types** for abstract computation.

**Causal States as Types**:

- **Minimality**: They capture exactly the information required for prediction.
- **Compositionality**: They support systematic combination and transformation.
- **Unifilarity**: Transitions between types are deterministic given new observations.

By treating causal states as types, we establish a typing system where types represent the predictively relevant features of histories, enabling abstract computation over sequences.

### 3.2 How Prediction Induces Structure and Types

The process of learning to predict next tokens induces a structure over sequences:

1. **Equivalence Classes**: Histories are grouped based on predictive equivalence.
2. **Types**: Each equivalence class (causal state) serves as a type, characterizing the possible future behaviors.
3. **Type Transitions**: The transition between types is governed by the observed tokens, and due to unifilarity, these transitions are deterministic.

This structure allows for the development of abstract computational abilities:

- **Systematic Generalization**: The model can apply learned patterns to new contexts that share the same type.
- **Error Correction**: Due to synchronization properties, the model can recover from incorrect predictions by realigning with the correct type.
- **Abstract Reasoning**: Types encapsulate higher-level concepts beyond individual tokens, enabling reasoning over abstract entities.

## 4. Examples Illustrating Typed Processes

### 4.1 Assembly Program Execution

Consider a sequence of assembly instructions:

```assembly
mov eax, 5    ; Type: RegisterAssignment
add eax, 3    ; Type: ArithmeticOperation
push eax      ; Type: StackOperation
pop ebx       ; Type: StackOperation
```

Each instruction changes the state of the machine and constrains the possible next instructions. By grouping sequences into types based on their effect on the machine state and the permissible next instructions, we see:

- **RegisterAssignment**: Instructions that assign values to registers.
- **ArithmeticOperation**: Instructions performing arithmetic using register values.
- **StackOperation**: Instructions manipulating the stack.

Sequences that lead to the same machine state and have the same permissible next instructions belong to the same type. This typing system emerges naturally from the predictive structure of the instruction sequences.

### 4.2 Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

Consider a language model solving a math problem:

```
Q: If Alice has 3 apples and buys 2 more, how many does she have?
Let's solve this step by step:
1) Initial amount = 3
2) Amount bought = 2
3) Total = 3 + 2 = 5
Therefore, Alice has 5 apples.
```

The reasoning process can be partitioned into types:

- **ProblemStatement**: The initial question.
- **ReasoningStep**: Intermediate steps in the problem-solving process.
- **Conclusion**: The final answer.

Each type dictates the structure of the possible next steps. For example, after a **ProblemStatement**, the next expected type is a **ReasoningStep**. This structured approach mirrors how the model predicts and generates coherent and logical sequences.

## 5. Formalizing Typed Processes

### 5.1 Formal Definition of Typed Processes

We define a **Typed Process** as a stochastic process where each history is assigned a type based on its causal state.

**Definition 4 (Typed Process)**: A typed process is a tuple \( (\Sigma, \mathcal{S}, \tau) \), where:

- \( \Sigma \) is the alphabet of symbols.
- \( \mathcal{S} \) is the set of causal states (types).
- \( \tau: \Sigma^* \rightarrow \mathcal{S} \) assigns types to histories based on predictive equivalence.

The typing function \( \tau \) satisfies:

- **Predictive Sufficiency**: \( P(X_{>t} | h) = P(X_{>t} | \tau(h)) \).
- **Minimality**: \( \mathcal{S} \) is minimal in cardinality among all such partitions.

### 5.2 Optimality of Causal States as Types

We establish that causal states are optimal types for abstract computation due to:

- **Predictive Optimality**: They capture all information necessary for optimal prediction.
- **Minimal Complexity**: They represent the minimal sufficient statistics, ensuring computational efficiency.
- **Deterministic Transitions**: Unifilarity guarantees that the next type is uniquely determined by the current type and next symbol.

**Theorem 1**: Among all possible typing systems based on predictive equivalence, the causal states form the minimal and sufficient set of types that preserve predictive power.

### 5.3 Connection to Language Models

Language models can be seen as approximating typed processes:

- **Hidden States as Types**: The model's hidden states correspond to types capturing predictive information.
- **State Transitions**: The update of hidden states upon receiving new tokens mirrors the deterministic transitions between types in an ε-machine.
- **Prediction and Generation**: The model generates next tokens based on the current type (hidden state), aiming to produce sequences consistent with the learned structure.

## 6. Practical Implications for Language Models

### 6.1 Transformers and Continuous Representations

Transformers use attention mechanisms to process sequences, allowing them to capture dependencies over long distances. The continuous hidden states in transformers can be interpreted as approximations of mixed causal states.

- **Mixed States**: Instead of discrete causal states, transformers maintain continuous representations that blend multiple predictive futures.
- **Attention Mechanism**: By attending to relevant parts of the input, the model updates its hidden state in a manner similar to transitioning between causal states.

### 6.2 Synchronization and Rapid Adaptation

Language models exhibit rapid adaptation to new contexts, akin to synchronization in ε-machines:

- **Exponential Convergence**: The model quickly reduces uncertainty about the context, aligning its internal state with the structure of the input.
- **Entropy Reduction**: As the model processes more tokens, its predictive uncertainty decreases, enabling more accurate and contextually appropriate predictions.

### 6.3 Emergence of Abstract Computation

The framework of typed processes explains how language models develop abstract computational abilities:

- **Systematic Generalization**: The model applies learned patterns to new contexts that share the same type.
- **Abstract Reasoning**: By operating over types rather than individual tokens, the model can perform computations involving higher-level concepts.
- **Error Correction and Robustness**: Synchronization properties allow the model to recover from deviations, maintaining coherent outputs.

## 7. Conclusion

We have introduced Typed Processes as a theoretical framework that connects statistical prediction in language models with the emergence of abstract computation. By demonstrating that causal states form an optimal typing system based on predictive equivalence, we provide a rigorous explanation for how next-token prediction can lead to higher-order computational abilities.

This framework offers insights into the internal mechanisms of language models, explaining their ability to perform tasks that require reasoning and abstraction. It also suggests principles for designing intelligent systems that compute with learned abstractions, extending beyond language models to any domain involving sequential data.

**Future Directions**:

- **Model Interpretability**: Applying the framework to analyze and interpret the internal states of language models.
- **Architecture Design**: Leveraging the properties of typed processes to inform the design of neural architectures that better capture causal structures.
- **Beyond Language**: Extending the concepts to other sequential data domains, such as time-series analysis and reinforcement learning.

By bridging statistical learning and abstract computation, Typed Processes provide a foundational theory for understanding and advancing artificial intelligence systems.

# Appendix: Detailed Theoretical Foundations with Proofs

In this appendix, we provide rigorous mathematical foundations for the concepts introduced in the main body of the paper. We delve into the definitions, theorems, and proofs that underpin the framework of Typed Processes, connecting computational mechanics, type theory, and language models.

## A. Computational Mechanics and Causal States

### A.1 Definitions and Properties

**Definition A.1 (Stochastic Process)**: Let \( \Sigma \) be a finite alphabet. A stochastic process is a sequence of random variables \( \{ X_t \}_{t \in \mathbb{N}} \), where each \( X_t \) takes values in \( \Sigma \). The joint distribution of the sequence is denoted \( P(\ldots, X_{t-1}, X_t, X_{t+1}, \ldots) \).

**Definition A.2 (History and Future)**: For any time \( t \), the **history** up to time \( t \) is \( \overleftarrow{x}_t = ( \ldots, x_{t-2}, x_{t-1} ) \), and the **future** from time \( t \) is \( \overrightarrow{x}_t = ( x_t, x_{t+1}, x_{t+2}, \ldots ) \).

### A.2 Causal States

**Definition A.3 (Causal Equivalence Relation)**: Two histories \( \overleftarrow{x} \) and \( \overleftarrow{x}' \) are **causally equivalent**, denoted \( \overleftarrow{x} \sim_\epsilon \overleftarrow{x}' \), if:

$$ P( \overrightarrow{X} | \overleftarrow{x} ) = P( \overrightarrow{X} | \overleftarrow{x}' ) $$

**Definition A.4 (Causal State)**: A **causal state** \( s \) is an equivalence class of histories under \( \sim_\epsilon \):

$$ s = \{ \overleftarrow{x} : \overleftarrow{x} \sim_\epsilon \overleftarrow{x}' \text{ for some } \overleftarrow{x}' \} $$

**Definition A.5 (ε-Machine)**: The **ε-machine** \( \mathcal{M} \) of a stochastic process is a tuple \( (\mathcal{S}, \Sigma, T) \) where:

- \( \mathcal{S} \) is the set of causal states.
- \( \Sigma \) is the alphabet.
- \( T: \mathcal{S} \times \Sigma \to \mathcal{S} \) is the transition function defined by:

  $$ T(s, x) = s' $$

  where \( s' \) is the causal state reached after observing symbol \( x \) from state \( s \).

### A.3 Properties of Causal States

#### A.3.1 Predictive Sufficiency

**Theorem A.1 (Predictive Sufficiency of Causal States)**:

The causal state \( s \) is a sufficient statistic for predicting the future:

$$ P( \overrightarrow{X} | \overleftarrow{x} ) = P( \overrightarrow{X} | s ) $$

**Proof**:

By definition of causal equivalence, all histories \( \overleftarrow{x} \) in the same causal state \( s \) satisfy:

$$ P( \overrightarrow{X} | \overleftarrow{x} ) = P( \overrightarrow{X} | s ) $$

Therefore, knowing the causal state \( s \) is sufficient for predicting the future \( \overrightarrow{X} \).

#### A.3.2 Minimality

**Theorem A.2 (Minimality of Causal States)**:

Among all sufficient statistics for predicting the future of the process, the causal states \( \mathcal{S} \) have minimal entropy:

$$ H( \mathcal{S} ) = \min_{S'} H( S' ) $$

where \( S' \) ranges over all sufficient statistics of \( \overleftarrow{X} \) for \( \overrightarrow{X} \).

**Proof**:

Let \( S' \) be any sufficient statistic for predicting \( \overrightarrow{X} \) given \( \overleftarrow{X} \):

$$ P( \overrightarrow{X} | \overleftarrow{X} ) = P( \overrightarrow{X} | S' ) $$

Since causal states are defined via the finest partition where each class corresponds to a unique predictive distribution, any coarser partition would merge histories with different predictive distributions, violating sufficiency. Therefore, the causal states represent the minimal sufficient statistics, leading to minimal entropy \( H( \mathcal{S} ) \).

### A.4 Unifilarity

**Definition A.6 (Unifilarity)**:

An ε-machine is **unifilar** if the next causal state \( s' \) is uniquely determined by the current state \( s \) and the next observed symbol \( x \):

$$ s' = T(s, x) $$

**Lemma A.1**:

In a unifilar ε-machine, the probability of a sequence \( x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n \) starting from state \( s_0 \) is:

$$ P( x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n | s_0 ) = \prod_{i=1}^n P( x_i | s_{i-1} ) $$

where \( s_i = T( s_{i-1}, x_i ) \).

**Proof**:

Since the next state and the probability of observing \( x_i \) depend only on \( s_{i-1} \) due to unifilarity, we have:

$$ P( x_i | x_1 x_2 \ldots x_{i-1}, s_0 ) = P( x_i | s_{i-1} ) $$

Therefore:

$$ P( x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n | s_0 ) = \prod_{i=1}^n P( x_i | s_{i-1} ) $$

## B. ε-Transducers and Input-Output Processes

### B.1 Definitions

**Definition B.1 (Input-Output Process)**:

An **input-output process** is a stochastic process involving pairs \( (X_t, Y_t) \), where \( X_t \) is the input at time \( t \) and \( Y_t \) is the corresponding output.

**Definition B.2 (Causal Equivalence for Input-Output)**:

Two joint histories \( (\overleftarrow{x}, \overleftarrow{y}) \) and \( (\overleftarrow{x}', \overleftarrow{y}') \) are causally equivalent if:

$$ P( \overrightarrow{Y} | \overleftarrow{x}, \overleftarrow{y}, \overrightarrow{x} ) = P( \overrightarrow{Y} | \overleftarrow{x}', \overleftarrow{y}', \overrightarrow{x} ) $$

**Definition B.3 (ε-Transducer)**:

An ε-transducer is a tuple \( (\mathcal{S}, X, Y, T) \) where:

- \( \mathcal{S} \) is the set of causal states.
- \( X \) and \( Y \) are the input and output alphabets.
- \( T: \mathcal{S} \times X \times Y \to \mathcal{S} \) is the transition function.

### B.2 Properties

**Lemma B.1 (Predictive Sufficiency in ε-Transducers)**:

Causal states in ε-transducers are sufficient statistics for predicting future outputs given future inputs.

**Proof**:

By the definition of causal equivalence in input-output processes, the causal state \( s \) encapsulates all the information from the joint history \( (\overleftarrow{x}, \overleftarrow{y}) \) necessary to predict \( \overrightarrow{Y} \) given \( \overrightarrow{X} \):

$$ P( \overrightarrow{Y} | \overleftarrow{x}, \overleftarrow{y}, \overrightarrow{x} ) = P( \overrightarrow{Y} | s, \overrightarrow{x} ) $$

Therefore, knowing \( s \) and the future inputs \( \overrightarrow{x} \) is sufficient for predicting \( \overrightarrow{Y} \).

**Lemma B.2 (Unifilarity in ε-Transducers)**:

An ε-transducer is unifilar if the next causal state \( s' \) is uniquely determined by the current state \( s \), the next input \( x \), and the next output \( y \):

$$ s' = T( s, x, y ) $$

**Proof**:

By unifilarity, the causal state transitions are deterministic given the current state and the observed input-output pair \( (x, y) \).

## C. Synchronization in Finite-State Sources

### C.1 Exact Synchronization

**Definition C.1 (Synchronization Word)**:

A word \( w \in \Sigma^* \) is a **synchronizing word** for an ε-machine \( \mathcal{M} \) if observing \( w \) brings the observer to a known causal state \( s \), regardless of the starting state.

**Theorem C.1 (Exact Synchronization Theorem)**:

For an exact ε-machine, there exists a synchronizing word \( w \) such that, after observing \( w \), the observer's uncertainty about the state is zero.

**Proof**:

Since the ε-machine is exact, its state diagram is strongly connected and has synchronizing words. By the property of unifilarity, once the synchronizing word is observed, the observer can deterministically infer the current state.

### C.2 Exponential Convergence

**Theorem C.2 (Exponential Convergence of Synchronization)**:

The probability that an observer is not synchronized after observing a sequence of length \( L \) decreases exponentially with \( L \):

$$ P( \text{Not Synchronized at } L ) \leq K \alpha^L $$

where \( K > 0 \) and \( 0 < \alpha < 1 \) are constants depending on the ε-machine.

**Proof**:

The proof follows from the properties of finite-state Markov chains. Since the ε-machine is exact and unifilar, the probability of not being synchronized after \( L \) steps is dominated by the second-largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix governing the observer's uncertainty. This eigenvalue is less than 1, leading to exponential decay.

## D. Typed Processes in Language Models

### D.1 Typed Processes and Predictive Equivalence

**Definition D.1 (Predictive Type Assignment)**:

A **type assignment** \( \tau: \Sigma^* \to \mathcal{T} \) maps histories to types based on their causal states:

$$ \tau( h ) = \epsilon( h ) $$

where \( \epsilon( h ) \) is the causal state of history \( h \).

**Theorem D.1 (Types as Minimal Sufficient Statistics)**:

The types assigned by \( \tau \) are minimal sufficient statistics for prediction.

**Proof**:

From Theorem A.2, causal states are minimal sufficient statistics. Since \( \tau \) maps histories to their causal states, the types inherit this property.

### D.2 Optimality of Causal States as Types

**Theorem D.2 (Optimality of Causal States as Types)**:

Among all possible type assignments preserving predictive sufficiency, the causal states form the minimal set.

**Proof**:

Assume there exists another type assignment \( \tau' \) with a set of types \( \mathcal{T}' \) such that \( |\mathcal{T}'| < |\mathcal{S}| \) and \( \tau' \) is sufficient for prediction. This would imply a coarser partition than the causal states, which contradicts the minimality of causal states established in Theorem A.2. Therefore, no such \( \tau' \) exists, and the causal states are the optimal types.

## E. Continuous Representations in Language Models

### E.1 Mixed Causal States

**Definition E.1 (Mixed Causal State)**:

A **mixed causal state** is a probability distribution over causal states:

$$ \mu = \{ ( s_i, p_i ) : s_i \in \mathcal{S}, p_i \geq 0, \sum_i p_i = 1 \} $$

**Lemma E.1**:

The mixed causal state \( \mu \) is a sufficient statistic for prediction:

$$ P( \overrightarrow{X} | \overleftarrow{x} ) = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} p_s P( \overrightarrow{X} | s ) $$

**Proof**:

Given the observer's uncertainty over the causal states, the predictive distribution is a weighted sum over the possible futures from each state, weighted by their probabilities \( p_s \).

### E.2 Transformers as Approximations of Mixed States

**Proposition E.1**:

The hidden states in transformer models can be viewed as continuous approximations of mixed causal states.

**Proof Sketch**:

Transformers use continuous vector representations (hidden states) to encode information about the sequence history. The attention mechanism updates these representations based on the input tokens and context. This process approximates maintaining a probability distribution over possible causal states, with the continuous vectors representing mixtures of states.

## F. Practical Considerations

### F.1 Unifilarity and Model Architecture

**Lemma F.1**:

Designing models with deterministic state transitions (analogous to unifilarity) can enhance predictive consistency.

**Proof Sketch**:

In unifilar ε-machines, the next state is uniquely determined by the current state and input, reducing uncertainty. Analogously, models that update their hidden states deterministically based on the current state and input can maintain consistency in prediction, leading to more stable and interpretable behavior.

### F.2 Training Methods for Synchronization

**Proposition F.1**:

Training strategies that emphasize context utilization and reduce predictive entropy encourage the development of minimal sufficient representations.

**Proof Sketch**:

By focusing on reducing the predictive uncertainty (entropy) in the model's outputs, training encourages the model to develop internal representations that capture all necessary information from the context. This aligns with the goal of synchronization, where the model's internal state becomes aligned with the structure of the input sequence.

# Additional Proofs and Theoretical Results

## G. Information-Theoretic Optimality

### G.1 Mutual Information and Sufficiency

**Definition G.1 (Mutual Information)**:

The mutual information between two random variables \( X \) and \( Y \) is:

$$ I( X ; Y ) = H( X ) - H( X | Y ) $$

where \( H( X ) \) is the entropy of \( X \), and \( H( X | Y ) \) is the conditional entropy of \( X \) given \( Y \).

**Theorem G.1**:

Causal states maximize the mutual information between the future and the representation:

$$ I( \overrightarrow{X} ; \mathcal{S} ) = I( \overrightarrow{X} ; \overleftarrow{X} ) $$

**Proof**:

Since causal states \( \mathcal{S} \) are functions of the history \( \overleftarrow{X} \), we have:

$$ I( \overrightarrow{X} ; \mathcal{S} ) \leq I( \overrightarrow{X} ; \overleftarrow{X} ) $$

But because \( \mathcal{S} \) is a sufficient statistic for \( \overrightarrow{X} \):

$$ I( \overrightarrow{X} ; \overleftarrow{X} ) = I( \overrightarrow{X} ; \mathcal{S} ) $$

Therefore, the causal states capture all the mutual information between the history and the future.

### G.2 Minimal Entropy of Causal States

**Theorem G.2**:

Among all sufficient statistics \( S' \), the causal states \( \mathcal{S} \) minimize the entropy \( H( S' ) \).

**Proof**:

From Theorem A.2, causal states are minimal sufficient statistics. Any other sufficient statistic \( S' \) must have entropy \( H( S' ) \geq H( \mathcal{S} ) \). If \( H( S' ) < H( \mathcal{S} ) \), \( S' \) cannot be sufficient, as it would represent a coarser partition, losing predictive information.

## H. Typed Processes and Type Systems

### H.1 Type Operations and Composition

**Definition H.1 (Type Composition)**:

Given two types \( \tau_1, \tau_2 \in \mathcal{T} \), their composition \( \tau_1 \circ \tau_2 \) represents the type after sequentially applying \( \tau_1 \) and \( \tau_2 \).

**Lemma H.1**:

Type composition is associative:

$$ ( \tau_1 \circ \tau_2 ) \circ \tau_3 = \tau_1 \circ ( \tau_2 \circ \tau_3 ) $$

**Proof**:

Since the composition of types corresponds to the composition of functions (or operations), and function composition is associative, the associativity of type composition follows.

### H.2 Subtyping and Abstraction

**Definition H.2 (Subtype Relation)**:

A type \( \tau_1 \) is a **subtype** of \( \tau_2 \), denoted \( \tau_1 \leq \tau_2 \), if any instance of \( \tau_1 \) can be used wherever \( \tau_2 \) is expected without loss of correctness.

**Lemma H.2**:

If \( \tau_1 \leq \tau_2 \), then \( \tau_1 \) provides at least as much predictive information as \( \tau_2 \):

$$ I( \overrightarrow{X} ; \tau_1 ) \geq I( \overrightarrow{X} ; \tau_2 ) $$

**Proof**:

Since \( \tau_1 \) is a subtype of \( \tau_2 \), it refines \( \tau_2 \) by containing more detailed information. Therefore, the mutual information between \( \overrightarrow{X} \) and \( \tau_1 \) must be at least as great as that between \( \overrightarrow{X} \) and \( \tau_2 \).

### H.3 Type Safety and Predictive Consistency

**Theorem H.1 (Type Safety in Typed Processes)**:

Operations on types in a typed process preserve predictive consistency.

**Proof**:

In a typed process, the types are assigned based on predictive equivalence classes. Operations that manipulate these types, such as composition and abstraction, must respect the underlying predictive distributions to maintain consistency. Since the transitions between types are deterministic and based on observed symbols (unifilarity), applying operations in accordance with the typing rules ensures that the predictive relationships remain valid.

# Conclusion of the Appendix

This detailed appendix has provided rigorous mathematical foundations for the concepts presented in the main body of the paper. We have formalized the definitions of causal states and ε-machines, proved their properties, and established their optimality as minimal sufficient statistics for prediction.

By connecting these concepts to type theory, we have shown how causal states can serve as types in a computational framework, enabling abstract computation over sequences. We have also explored how language models approximate these theoretical constructs through continuous representations and how their architectures and training strategies align with the principles of synchronization and unifilarity.

These theoretical foundations not only enhance our understanding of how statistical prediction leads to abstract computation but also provide a solid basis for future research and development in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
